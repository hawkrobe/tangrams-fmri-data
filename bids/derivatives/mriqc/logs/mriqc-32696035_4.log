AnacondaPy 5.3.1 is deprecated and should not be used for new work.

	module anacondapy/5.3.1 loaded.
	5.3.1 contains an old version of the conda command.
	Use 'source activate' not 'conda activate' or you will get an error.
	Newer modules with the YYYY.MM version format do not have this problem.
	This version (5.3.1) should continue to be used with environments
	created with it. Otherwise, you may get GLIBCXX_version errors.
