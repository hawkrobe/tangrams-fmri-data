0	16440	Okay.
16440	37480	Okay.
37480	54560	Okay, so the shape looks like, oh my gosh, so there is a tiny little rhombus, like a
54560	60200	square at the very top, and it's tilted ever so slightly to the left, and then underneath
60200	70480	it, it's like a very jagged shape. It looks like a cliff. It kind of looks like the rhombus
70480	83560	or the square is pushing a triangle off of a cliff. What else? The triangle that it's
83560	96800	pushing is kind of off to the right, and, oh, I don't know. The bottom of the shape
96800	104800	has kind of a little triangle that's peeking out from the larger geometric shape, the little
104800	110560	triangle kind of peeking out towards the left, and it's sort of underneath like...
110560	117160	Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't... I'm... I'm sorry.
119960	120460	Okay.
120960	121460	Sorry.
122960	127160	Yeah, I can hear her. What do I do? I just listen and then wait for instructions.
127160	141160	Okay. Okay. Yeah. Sorry.
141160	142160	Are we good?
142160	143160	Yeah.
143160	150160	Okay. So this shape looks like basically kind of a person kneeling and putting their hands
150160	155160	out in front of them. Their hands are kind of facing to the right, and so, right, it's
155160	160160	got like that diamond shape at the top that's the head, and then they're kind of kneeling
160160	165160	on the ground, and it looks like their legs are kind of sticking back up behind them,
165160	171160	and they've got their hands kind of out in front of them like they're presenting something
171160	186160	to the right of them. The... to like the left side of the shape kind of... Yeah.
192160	197160	Okay. This one looks like a house with an arrow to the left of it.
201160	203160	Yeah.
212160	219160	Oh my gosh. Okay. So this one, once again, has like that diamond square shape at the
219160	226160	top of it. It's pointing up and down. It's not tilted at all, and then it kind of looks...
226160	233160	But underneath it is... Oh my gosh, I don't even know how to describe it. So the very,
233160	238160	very bottom of the shape is a tiny triangle that's pointed downwards off to the right,
238160	246160	and then that is kind of attached to a larger triangle pointing upwards. The whole shape,
246160	253160	I guess, kind of looks like somebody... Yeah. Great.
256160	267160	Okay. This one looks like there is a diamond, and it's just on a cliff. Like it's the head
267160	274160	shape that's kind of pointing like normally up and down, and then it's on top of just
274160	280160	a geometric shape that looks like a cliff. It's not like falling off the cliff or anything,
280160	303160	but it's just... Okay. This one kind of looks like a guy doing martial arts almost. So
303160	312160	you've got the normal, the head shape, that vertical diamond piece, and then the bottom
312160	320160	of it, that is on top of a shape with... It's got a trapezoidal piece sticking out to the
320160	327160	right, and there is a triangular cutout on the left, and on the right, I guess. There's
327160	334160	actually two triangular cutouts. But yeah, so the left side of the shape is essentially,
334160	340160	it's like flat except for one triangular cutout, and then the right side of the shape has a
340160	363160	longer, thinner piece kind of protruding from it. Yeah. Okay. This one is kind of like the
363160	367160	other one where the person was kneeling and pointing to the right, but it doesn't have
367160	374160	the little piece sticking up on the left. So it looks like a person facing to the right
374160	378160	with their hands pointing out in front of them, but they're kind of squatting rather
378160	392160	than kneeling. Okay. This one looks like a person who is standing on just one leg, and
392160	399160	their other leg is kind of kicked out in front of them. The square little head piece is tilted
399160	409160	back to the right, and then they've also got, I guess, almost like their arm is kind of
409160	414160	sticking out in front of them and down. I don't know. So the right side of the shape
414160	428160	has the square on it and it's flat. Yeah. Okay. This one is a symmetrical shape. It
428160	435160	kind of looks like a pine cone. It's got a flat square at the top and then two triangular
435160	450160	pieces. This one kind of looks like, I guess, a dog almost. It doesn't have a tail or anything,
450160	456160	but it's got a trapezoidal piece at the very top and then a neck that connects it down
456160	465160	to a body, and then the front legs are trapezoidal, and then the, I guess, more like a parallelogram.
465160	470160	They're parallelograms, not trapezoids. But then the back legs is like two triangles stuck
470160	483160	together. Yeah. This one is also a symmetrical shape. It has the square pointing with like
483160	488160	a corner pointing up to the top, and then underneath it, it kind of looks like, I guess,
488160	496160	almost like a hat. Not really. So it's symmetrical, and underneath the little square pointing
496160	518160	up is like a little, like a thinner piece. This one looks like a person holding a wine
518160	523160	glass, or like a bartee glass almost, I guess. So there's the very top of the shape has the
523160	530160	square head that's pointing up, and then there's also a little triangle piece kind of holding
530160	544160	off to the side. Yeah. Okay. This one looks like a ghost. It's got, the very top of it
544160	549160	has two kind of triangular cutouts, so it kind of looks like it's raising its hands
549160	556160	up a little bit, and then the body gets thinner and kind of crooks out to the right. So the
556160	562160	top half of it is symmetrical, and then there's two kind of pieces that come off. There's
562160	569160	one piece that comes off and then down to the right of it. It reminds me of a ghost.
569160	583160	I think I already said that. So yeah, the bottom half kind of has like two parallelogram
583160	592160	shapes almost, and then the top half has like what looks like two triangles stuck to like
592160	605160	a house shape. Yeah. This one looks like a tiny dog riding on top of a slightly larger
605160	611160	dog, or I guess almost a horse. So there's like a little square and then a parallelogram,
611160	626160	and those are on top of like what looks like a horse kind of running. This one just looks
626160	635160	like a baby kind of swaddled together, so it's got like that square that's pointed up towards
635160	652160	the top, and then its body is kind of just like a blob. This one looks like kind of
652160	660160	a fish wearing a top hat, but like instead of... Okay, so like there's a flat square
660160	665160	at the very top of the shape, and then the very bottom of the shape has two triangles
665160	672160	kind of jutting off to the bottom, and I guess like it looks like it's a fish with like a
672160	685160	jet pack and a top hat on. Yeah. This one looks like someone taking a step to their
685160	693160	left, and they've got like their hands kind of pushing out to the left too. It's got the
693160	710160	head... Yeah. Okay, this one looks like that little, the diamond head shape on a pedestal,
711160	716160	or almost like a toilet, like at the very top back part of like a toilet, or like a
716160	734160	pedestal. It's got... Okay, this one looks like a girl with a bow in her hair and she's
734160	738160	sitting against something to her left, and it's kind of got like her knees stretched
738160	753160	up in front of her, so it's got two triangle pieces. Awesome. This is a symmetrical shape.
753160	758160	It's... Oh my god, I don't even know how to describe what it looks like, but it's got
758160	775160	kind of like a trapezoid cut out from the top. Okay, this one kind of looks like a swan
775160	792160	laying an egg or a triangular egg or a triangular poop. I don't know. It's got... Yeah. This
792160	796160	one looks like a person sitting against something to their right, and they've got like their
796160	801160	knees kind of stretched up and their head tilted down towards their legs a little bit.
801160	817160	You can kind of see their feet. This one looks like a horse that doesn't have any front legs,
817160	822160	so it's got kind of a triangular head and then like two kind of trapezoids for a body
822160	845160	and then a triangular back feet, but it doesn't have any front legs. It's... Yeah.
845160	854160	Okay, this one kind of looks like someone doing a dance almost. It's got like a long,
854160	861160	flowy dress with like a train out to the back. It's got the head tilted like way back into
861160	866160	the left, and there's like a small triangle at the very bottom that's jutting out to the
866160	884160	right, and then the rest of the bottom of the shape looks like a long train on a dress.
884160	891160	Okay, this one kind of looks like a shrimp, I guess, almost, or maybe like a pistol, like
891160	906160	a gun. It's got like kind of a parallelogram like shape at the very top, and then... This
906160	911160	one looks like someone trying to take flight, or like an angel almost. It's got like two
911160	916160	kind of parallelogram wings coming off of a parallelogram body, and then it's got like
916160	921160	a little head, a square head at the top, and it looks like the person's like kneeling
921160	927160	to the left and is trying to take flight, or is flying through the air kind of shifted
927160	939160	left. The square top of the head is tilted to the left a little bit as well, and it kind
939160	961160	of... Oh, I don't know. Yeah. This one looks like a person sitting on a dog or like a horse
961160	967160	that's moving, so it's got a square, it's a tiny square head and a triangular body on
967160	984160	top of like a little... Yeah. This one looks like someone holding out like a square gift,
984160	1002160	so the very top of the shape has like a small triangle pointing to the left, and then...
1002160	1007160	Okay. This one looks like someone facing to the left and like holding their hands out,
1007160	1014160	but they've got like long, flowy sleeves on, so you can see their hands kind of out, and
1014160	1019160	then their sleeves are looking down. This person is like facing to the left, it's got
1019160	1028160	that head shape, that square rhombus shape pointing up, and then the body is kind of
1028160	1046160	like... Yeah. This one looks like a horse prancing around, it has a triangle head at
1046160	1065160	the very top. This one has, at the very top of the shape, has two little triangle pieces
1065160	1074160	jutting out and towards the left. It also has the square piece, but that is like down
1074160	1097160	towards the bottom. I don't really know what it looks like. Okay. This one has a very
1097160	1101160	geometric shape, it doesn't really look like a person or anything, or like an animal or
1101160	1109160	something. It has, at the very top, a trapezoid connected to a long rectangle, and then there's
1109160	1120160	also a large triangle jutting out to the left of it. It has, in the top right, it has a
1120160	1133160	square cut out with a little triangle piece also missing. Yeah. Okay, this shape kind
1133160	1141160	of looks like a lamp post with two speakers jutting out from it, or two sides jutting
1141160	1159160	out from it. This one looks like a brachiosaurus, but with no legs, so it's got a very square
1159160	1173160	rectangular base and a long tall neck. This one looks like someone ice skating, or like
1173160	1178160	a ballerina, like in arabesque, like they're putting their leg out behind them and they've
1178160	1192160	got their two arms kind of sticking out to the front. This one looks like a house with
1192160	1219160	like a really tall smokestack to the right of it, or like a tall chimney to the right
1219160	1245160	of it. Good. That's good. Yep. Okay.
1249160	1253160	Okay.
