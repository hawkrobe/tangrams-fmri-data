0	4000	Sounds good.
20000	22000	Okay.
22000	26000	Um, am I allowed to start?
26000	28000	Okay.
28000	34000	So this one, it has a rhombus head.
34000	42000	Um, it kind of looks like there's a foot extending to the right and a triangular base.
42000	48000	And then there's a trapezoidal figure kind of jutting off to the left side.
48000	50000	Um.
51000	57000	Is there a white space that's a trapezoid on the left side?
57000	62000	Like the middle of the figure left side is like a large trapezoid.
62000	64000	No.
64000	67000	I'm gonna describe the black space.
67000	72000	So the head part is a rhombus.
72000	79000	And then right beneath that it's kind of triangular connected to a rectangle.
79000	84000	And then jutting off to the left is a trapezoid.
84000	93000	And then it's on a triangular base with a small triangle extending off to the bottom right.
93000	96000	Okay. I think I know which one it is.
96000	102000	Is the white space in the middle of the figure on the right side, uh, and it's a trapezoid?
102000	103000	Yes.
103000	105000	Okay. I'm gonna select.
105000	107000	Okay.
109000	134000	So this one, describing the black space again, there's like kind of a central pole with what looks like two triangles extending on both the right and the left side.
134000	137000	Is the right triangle slightly higher than the left triangle?
137000	138000	Yes.
138000	141000	Okay. I think I know which one it is. I'm gonna select.
141000	154000	Okay.
155000	165000	Okay. So this one, again, there's a rhombus head and then the body part, it looks like a scoop.
165000	180000	The left side looks like a square and the right side kind of has like a jagged shape, some triangular cutouts.
180000	182000	Uh, I'm not sure about this one.
182000	183000	Can you keep describing?
183000	199000	Yes. Okay. So rhombus head and then directly below that, there's like a flat line, um, with the right side of the flat line kind of in a point and the left side is just square.
199000	215000	And then the whole left side of the body part is still just square, but the right side kind of has, if you're looking at the right, at the white space, it's kind of like a trapezoidal cutout a little bit, like the upper right part of a trapezoid.
215000	222000	And then there's also a triangular cutout on the right bottom part.
222000	224000	What?
224000	226000	Oh, okay. I think I know.
226000	227000	So it's like...
227000	229000	Yeah, I think I got it. It's...
229000	242000	So describing the bottom block, it's a large black rectangle. Starting from the bottom, it's a triangular cutout with the tip facing left and then it like extends outward to the right as you go up.
242000	243000	Yes.
243000	246000	Culminating in like a point on the upper right.
246000	248000	Yeah. Selected.
248000	249000	Yeah.
257000	260000	Okay.
260000	265000	This one, we're going to start from the left side.
265000	270000	So on the top left, there's a triangle.
270000	276000	And then directly below that, it's like connected to another triangle.
276000	284000	And then moving to the right, there's kind of this rectangular connection.
284000	292000	Is there like a square or a square turned 45 degrees to the left in the top middle?
292000	293000	Yes.
293000	295000	It's like a little bit connected to a triangle, but there's some white space?
295000	300000	Yes, exactly. And then there's a triangle on the...
300000	303000	Sorry, on the far right, there's a triangle connected only by the point.
303000	305000	Correct.
305000	307000	Okay, selecting.
315000	321000	Okay, this one, a rhombus head.
321000	330000	And it kind of looks like if a person were standing on one leg and extending a leg behind them, they're facing the left.
330000	333000	And the left side is like two triangles stacked on top of one another?
333000	334000	Yes.
334000	336000	Okay, selecting.
345000	353000	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like a horse facing left with triangular feet.
353000	359000	The far right is like a parallelogram with a point facing up and right?
359000	361000	Yes.
361000	364000	Selecting.
374000	381000	Okay, this one, it has a right triangular base.
381000	385000	And then there's kind of a square at the top of the point of the triangle.
385000	388000	And then what looks like kind of bunny ears coming off of that.
388000	392000	Okay, got it. It's a bunny leaning against a wall facing right, yeah?
392000	394000	Yeah.
404000	408000	Okay, this just looks like a rectangular...
408000	410000	Okay, so there's... Sorry.
410000	413000	There's a rhombus on the top.
413000	421000	And then directly below that there's kind of just this big black bar with triangular points on either end.
421000	423000	Yeah, I got it.
423000	425000	Okay.
435000	443000	Okay, so this one, it kind of looks like the letter I.
443000	450000	But it has a rhombus on top and then a rectangle directly below that.
450000	456000	And then kind of there's like an addition to the left of the rectangle.
456000	459000	And there's a triangle facing right about the same height.
459000	460000	Correct.
460000	462000	Got it.
464000	476000	Okay, this one, there's a rhombus that's kind of on the top right.
476000	485000	And then directly below that there's a big triangle with a sort of trapezoidal looking shape extending off the left.
485000	487000	And the upside down triangle.
487000	490000	And there's a small triangle on the bottom left corner, right?
490000	492000	Yeah, very small on the bottom left.
492000	497000	And then an upside down triangle on the top left.
497000	499000	Okay, I think I got it.
507000	509000	Did you see the one I selected?
509000	510000	Yeah.
510000	517000	Okay, this one kind of looks like a guy with his arms in the air with his body like at a slant.
517000	518000	Yeah.
519000	522000	He's slanting leftward, yeah?
522000	525000	Like his head is, yeah, towards the top left.
537000	541000	Okay, this kind of looks like a person, a rhombus head.
541000	546000	And it looks like they're kneeling on their knees to the right.
546000	549000	And they're extending something in their hands kind of.
549000	552000	There's a cutout on the left that's a parallelogram, right?
552000	554000	Yes.
554000	561000	Yeah, it's not the one that, this one like has the kind of sharp triangular point on the left.
564000	567000	Like the bottom of the parallelogram is like a triangle pointing upward.
567000	568000	Yeah.
576000	586000	Okay, this one, it has a square on the top right.
586000	589000	And then a trapezoid on the top left.
589000	594000	And it kind of looks like someone's foot is kicking out, oh, sorry.
594000	597000	It looks like someone's foot is kicking out in front of them to the left.
599000	602000	Yeah, there's like two feet, the other one's on the ground, right?
602000	603000	Yes.
606000	621000	Okay, this one, it's kind of in the shape of a wishbone.
621000	626000	There's a triangle, sorry, there's a rectangle, sorry, a rhombus on the top.
626000	632000	Directly below that there's a triangle connected by a rectangle to like...
632000	637000	I mean, it's an upside down trapezoid with two parallelograms facing each other, right?
637000	639000	Upside down trapezoid with two parallelograms.
639000	643000	The face is a trapezoid upside down.
643000	645000	Yeah.
645000	650000	Or it looks like a crab lying on its back with its pinchers in the air.
650000	652000	Not really, no.
652000	654000	Okay, I think I have the wrong one.
654000	663000	Okay, rhombus on top, directly below that is a rectangle, sorry, a triangle, a right triangle.
663000	668000	Connected to the triangle is a rectangle extending down.
668000	680000	And then off of that is like two extending rectangles, one of them kind of has a triangular edge on it.
680000	686000	Is that helpful at all?
686000	688000	I'm still not sure.
688000	689000	Okay.
689000	691000	Can you start from the bottom?
691000	696000	Yeah, think of it, it kind of looks like a person with their legs spread wide facing left.
696000	704000	Oh, okay, so it has a trapezoidal cutout, the white space is a trapezoidal cutout on the left side.
704000	718000	Yes.
718000	727000	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like Finneas from Finneas and Ferb facing left.
727000	733000	It like has a triangle on the top, or a rectangle on the top connected to a triangle.
733000	735000	It's like a little cluster.
735000	737000	Do you get what I'm saying?
737000	745000	It's like a little cluster with a rectangle and two triangles and then kind of just like a weird face.
745000	747000	Facing left.
747000	759000	Okay, the bottom right, is it a right triangle that's like the top half is absorbed into the shape above it?
759000	768000	I would say the bottom right is more just like a rectangle.
768000	769000	Okay.
769000	770000	Okay.
770000	772000	I can start again.
772000	781000	So in the figure, like the middle section of the figure, there's a rectangular cutout, but there's a triangle extending left
781000	792000	and there's a square connected to the figure at two points with a little bit of white space between the square and the triangle.
792000	803000	Yes, but there's like kind of like three triangles, sorry, three, two triangles and one rectangle at the top.
803000	805000	Three triangles.
805000	808000	Sorry, I meant two triangles.
808000	809000	At the top?
809000	811000	Okay, let me just start over.
811000	816000	Okay, from the top going down, there's a rhombus.
816000	827000	And then to the left, there's a triangle, but part of the triangle is being absorbed into the rest of the figure.
827000	835000	And then on the right of the rhombus, there is a full triangle that's connected by the point.
835000	842000	And then the base kind of looks like someone's shoulders a little bit.
842000	851000	Okay, the top of the figure is a square turned 45 degrees and two triangles, the left triangle, is absorbed to the rest of the shape.
851000	856000	Yes.
856000	858000	I thought that one looked like a rat.
858000	864000	It looks like Binnie's to me.
864000	871000	Okay, this one, it looks like a house, but on the left of the house is like a chimney with a triangle on top.
871000	884000	Yeah, I got it.
884000	887000	Okay, this one, it's just kind of an odd shape.
887000	890000	It has like a really long rectangle.
890000	898000	There's a triangle kind of jutting off the left on each side of the rectangle.
898000	908000	The rectangle is at a 45 degree angle, and there's just kind of weird shapes jutting off each end.
908000	921000	The top left is a triangle, but the right side is absorbed into the rest of the shape.
921000	926000	I would say the top left is like a trapezoid.
926000	934000	Okay, it's a rectangular bar at a 45 degree angle right in the middle of the figure.
934000	936000	Okay, yeah, I think I got it.
936000	943000	There's also a trapezoid or one side of a trapezoid at the bottom right.
943000	956000	Yeah.
956000	961000	Okay, this one, it looks like a person, rhombus head.
961000	964000	They're facing the right with their arms extended.
964000	968000	The feet are two little triangles, right triangles.
968000	974000	No, the feet, it looks like they're bending their knees.
974000	979000	Okay, is there a cutout on the left side that's a parallelogram?
979000	982000	No, it's a triangle.
982000	985000	In the middle of the figure, I mean.
985000	986000	Oh, the cutout is a triangle.
986000	987000	Yeah.
987000	991000	It looks like they're bending one knee, but the other is straight.
991000	992000	Not really.
992000	996000	Okay, so top rhombus head, you go down.
996000	1002000	It looks like they're extending their hands to the right, but the hands are like half of a triangle.
1002000	1003000	Yes.
1003000	1008000	And then you go down below, and it looks like they're bending both of their knees to the right,
1008000	1013000	and there's like a parallelogram on the bottom.
1013000	1021000	Okay, so in the middle of the figure there's two cutouts that are both triangles.
1021000	1022000	One is on the right side.
1022000	1027000	There's one on the right side that's above the one on the left side.
1027000	1033000	Very slightly, yes, but those two cutouts kind of make the knees.
1033000	1036000	Well, right, but the right cutout is higher than that.
1036000	1047000	Like the point, the peak of the right cutout is at the same level as the left side of the left cutout.
1047000	1049000	The top side of the left cutout.
1049000	1050000	Exactly.
1062000	1073000	Okay, this, it looks like bunny ears, and then there's a triangle with a rectangle extending below,
1073000	1076000	and it kind of looks like it has two feet off to the left.
1076000	1081000	Yeah, there's like kind of a square on the left side that's only connected to the point of a triangle.
1081000	1082000	Yes.
1094000	1102000	Okay, this one is a little ambiguous, but starting from the top there's a square,
1102000	1105000	and then directly below that is a parallelogram,
1105000	1113000	and the parallelogram at two points is touching this other figure that kind of looks like a dog.
1115000	1117000	The dog is like kind of facing left.
1117000	1121000	It has a triangle off the tip of the far right.
1121000	1125000	And the left side of the figure is like two triangles stacked on top of each other.
1125000	1126000	Yes.
1132000	1146000	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like a top view of a scorpion.
1146000	1152000	The top has like two white triangular cutouts.
1152000	1159000	Yeah, and the right side is like a, the entire left side of the figure is like a,
1159000	1163000	the white space on the left side of the figure is like a large right triangle.
1163000	1166000	But like it was from top to bottom, so it's not really cut out.
1166000	1169000	Yeah, it's just like a straight line on the left side.
1169000	1170000	Yeah.
1170000	1171000	Okay.
1182000	1190000	Okay, this one, if it were to be a person, it would have a triangular head,
1190000	1193000	the point of the triangle facing left,
1193000	1200000	and it's connected by a very point, by like the very bottom point.
1200000	1208000	On the white space on the left side, there's a square that's connected at two points to the figure, but otherwise floating.
1208000	1211000	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
1211000	1232000	Okay, this one, it's kind of an ambiguous figure.
1232000	1238000	It is extending kind of from the upper left corner to the bottom right.
1238000	1246000	It's like a trapezoid, a triangle, a trapezoid, and a parallelogram, and then another triangle.
1246000	1252000	Okay, it goes from upper left to bottom right.
1252000	1254000	Yes.
1254000	1266000	Okay.
1266000	1277000	This one, it kind of looks like a figure eight made out of squares with a random rectangle on top.
1277000	1292000	Yep.
1292000	1299000	This one looks like a crab, a side view of a crab.
1299000	1304000	It's two parallelograms faced one another with an upside down trapezoid face.
1304000	1319000	Yes.
1319000	1326000	Okay, this one kind of looks like a man facing right with triangles for feet.
1326000	1329000	The top is a square that's centered in the figure.
1329000	1342000	Yeah, it looks like a top hat.
1342000	1349000	Okay, this one resembles the letter I, but it's kind of all connected.
1349000	1360000	And the base is a little round with a slight point off to the right.
1360000	1368000	Okay, the middle of the figure is a large square with a triangle facing upward and a rhombus connected to that triangle.
1368000	1380000	Correct.
1380000	1395000	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like a person with a rhombus head facing left, extending their arms out, and it looks like they're kind of wearing a cloak.
1395000	1399000	They have triangular feet, or like a little triangle to show their feet. Does that make sense?
1399000	1400000	Facing left?
1400000	1403000	Yeah, facing left, extending their arms out.
1403000	1409000	The bottom cut out on the left side is like a square with a triangle on the bottom side.
1409000	1421000	Yeah.
1421000	1441000	Okay, this one, it's like kind of a weird figure, but the top part is a parallelogram, and then there's a rectangle extending off the left side going down with a square at the very end.
1441000	1466000	Okay, this one, there's a rhombus head, and then directly below that is like two triangles kind of connected together to make it look almost like a square with a cut out on the right.
1466000	1488000	And then a rectangle kind of extending to the bottom right at a 45 degree angle, and then off the middle of that rectangle is another extension to the left that has a triangle at the bottom left.
1488000	1491000	Can you describe that again? That's a rhombus head.
1491000	1501000	Yes, rhombus head, and then directly below that, it's kind of like a square with a triangular cut out on the right.
1501000	1506000	Okay, yeah, it looks like a person doing a single leg squat.
1506000	1519000	Yeah.
1519000	1523000	Okay, this one's kind of a weird figure.
1523000	1534000	There's a square in the left connected at a singular point to this kind of triangle misshapen rectangle thing.
1534000	1537000	Okay, the bottom right, there's a right triangle facing right.
1537000	1550000	Yeah.
1550000	1555000	Okay, this one, it's pretty square.
1555000	1568000	So there's a square and then to the left extending upward is a large rectangle, ending in a little triangle facing left.
1568000	1578000	Can you describe one? Yeah, it kind of looks like a musical note.
1578000	1597000	Okay, square base, to the left, there's a long skinny rectangle extending upward.
1597000	1603000	Okay, this one looks like a dude sitting down with a square head.
1603000	1617000	Facing left. Yeah, hugging his knees.
1617000	1642000	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like a horse again, facing left, but really rectangular body, and then a parallelogram in the front and a triangle in the back.
1642000	1657000	This one, if you're kind of looking at the bottom left, there's a lone triangle and it's connected to the very point to this kind of slanted 45 degree angle line.
1657000	1672000	It looks like a flamingo jumping to the right. Yeah.
1672000	1676000	Okay, this one looks like a house with a very tall chimney to the right.
1702000	1714000	Good.
1714000	1724000	Pretty good. My left hand is like completely asleep.
1724000	1729000	Was I moving around too much or was...
