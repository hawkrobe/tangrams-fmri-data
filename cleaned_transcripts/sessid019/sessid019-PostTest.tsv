0	9000	Yep, yeah, I'm ready.
9000	12000	Yep.
12000	35000	Okay, there's some new shapes.
35000	40000	This is the one where bottom right side is a trapezoid.
40000	47000	It's connected by a long triangular pipe where in the middle there's a triangle that extends to the left.
47000	54000	At the top of this pipe, which by the way is at a 45 degree angle, is another trapezoidal shape.
54000	62000	On the right side, yeah.
62000	83000	Is it just the rectangular block at a 45 degree angle that goes from the top left to the bottom right of it?
83000	100000	A person kneeling with triangle cutouts.
100000	105000	This looks like a horse galloping to the left.
105000	109000	There's a triangle on the upper left side facing upward.
109000	124000	The right side is a parallelogram also facing upward.
124000	127000	It looks like a rat facing left.
127000	141000	This is the one that looks like Ferb, I think.
141000	160000	It looks like a cell phone tower. It's like the pole with the trapezoids extending off both sides.
160000	176000	A person riding a dog.
176000	181000	Looks like a person wearing a cloak, but it's not the one you said cloak.
181000	188000	The person is shaped similarly, but there's like a triangle extending off the bottom right.
188000	192000	Does it look like the letter I? Yes.
192000	208000	Kind of cursive-y? Yes.
208000	225000	It's the sphinx.
225000	233000	It's an odd shape that extends from the upper left to the bottom right.
233000	238000	The upper left is a triangle with the right side intersecting with the rest of the shape.
238000	244000	Does it look like a music note? No.
244000	250000	The bottom right is a right triangle with the top half intersected by the rest of the shape.
250000	269000	It goes from upper left to bottom right. It's more linear.
269000	284000	Monster.

333000	349000	The fountain.
349000	364000	Top hat.
364000	370000	Looks like a person standing on one leg with their right leg extended behind them.
370000	386000	There's a rhombus head in the upper left. Immediately below that it looks like two triangles stacked on top of one another.
386000	400000	A person hugging their knees.
400000	420000	A person kneeling with a parallelogram cut out.
420000	429000	The top of this figure is a very small triangle with the peak facing left and one of the sides connected at one point to a large right triangle.
429000	438000	Below that large right triangle there is a cut out on the left with a square connected at two points.
438000	453000	It kind of looks like someone bent over leaning left.
453000	468000	Body kick.
468000	483000	Looks like a person leaning left with hands in air.
483000	498000	An eye with extra.

580000	602000	Pipe.
602000	621000	Okay, take the cursive letter I want but make the rhombus. The rhombus is now on a flat upside down triangle.
621000	643000	Okay, take the letter I.
643000	659000	Okay, now this is the one originally you said looks like a person wearing a cloak. It's like hands to the left.
659000	678000	Kangaroo.
678000	698000	Parallelogram with like part hanging off the left downward.
698000	726000	This one to me looks like a person reclining drinking a martini. There's a rhombus head connected to essentially a square on the left side. There's an upside down triangle connected at one point.
726000	743000	This one kind of resembles the person riding a dog.
743000	760000	Music note.
760000	788000	Funny ears not on a mountain.
788000	797000	Okay, take the letter I.
