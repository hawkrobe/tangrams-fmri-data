0	27080	Okay, so this one has a triangle tilted to the left coming out of what looks like a trapezoid
27080	28080	with another triangle.
28720	31920	It kind of looks like a crane that's facing the right.
33360	34160	Yeah, I got it.
47200	54400	So this one looks like a guy that's wearing the backpack facing the right with a square on the top.
54400	70400	Yep.
70400	72400	Okay, this one looks like an animal.
72400	74400	Its head is facing to the left.
74400	80400	It's a triangle on the top connected to a square.
80400	84400	Its tail looks like an upside down trapezoid.
84400	86400	It's facing to the right.
86400	88400	To the left?
88400	90400	To the right.
90400	92400	The tails on the right.
92400	94400	The tails on the right.
94400	96400	The head on top is like equilateral.
96400	98400	Equilateral, yeah.
108400	118400	Okay, so this one has a rhombus on top and one of its points is touching a flat surface.
118400	126400	It kind of looks like a, like it could have been a square but it has a white space and it looks like a triangle.
126400	146400	And then it extends into a trapezoid on the right side and then like a rectangle with a triangle facing down.
146400	150400	Yeah, is the triangle pointed to the bottom left?
150400	152400	Yeah, yeah.
162400	166400	Okay, this one kind of looks like someone is performing a fan dance or something.
166400	178400	So the bottom left starts out with a parallelogram and then it extends into kind of like a trapezoid.
178400	190400	And then on the right side just touching that trapezoid is a triangle pointed towards the left and like down.
190400	202400	And then on the top left is a rhombus that's tilted to the top left and it's barely touching.
208400	212400	So bottom left is a parallelogram.
212400	214400	Rhombus parallelogram.
216400	221400	Is it, oh wait, I think I know what you're talking about.
221400	225400	So yeah, the top left is like a, it's like barely touching part of the left.
225400	226400	Yeah.
226400	243400	Okay, so this one kind of looks like someone is kneeling and like reading a book and they're facing the right.
243400	247400	So it's a rhombus on the top.
250400	255400	Is the thing on the right like, it's kind of like a triangular shape?
255400	257400	Yeah, yeah.
268400	279400	Okay, so this one looks like the person walking that's facing towards the left that's picking up his shoe and has like a square just barely touching the back.
285400	295400	Okay, this one looks like an origami animal of sorts.
295400	307400	So it starts with the top left and it has a triangle facing up and then it connects to a trapezoid that's tilted.
307400	309400	Yeah.
316400	321400	So this one looks like the big L.
321400	338400	Okay, this one looks like an animal with someone that's like dozing off riding it.
338400	346400	So it's, on the left side you're going to see like the white space kind of making a triangle pointing to the right.
347400	350400	And then, yeah.
358400	363400	And this one looks like a house with a tree on the left.
363400	380400	Okay, this one looks like someone's like raising their arms up and praising.
380400	386400	So the rhombus on top is more towards the left.
394400	411400	Okay, this one, so it starts out with a trapezoid facing downwards and then it has a parallelogram on either side and then the white space makes another trapezoid? Yeah.
411400	434400	Okay, this one has two triangles on top barely touching what is like another triangle.
434400	442400	And they're facing to the left, the triangles on top are facing left.
442400	449400	There's also a square. Yeah, there's a square. Yeah.
449400	467400	Okay, this one looks like a guy walking towards the left with really baggy pants, the rhombus on top. Yeah.
467400	495400	This one looks like a house with a really big chimney on the right side.
495400	506400	Okay, this is, this kind of looks like a stitch. It's like three triangles on the top, one of them facing left, one of them is pointing up and one of them facing to the right.
506400	516400	And they're all connected to a trapezoid that's facing down.
516400	533400	And then on the bottom right, there's like a parallelogram. Yeah. Okay.
533400	554400	Okay, so this one has a rhombus that's connected to two triangles. So the rhombus is on top and then at the point of contact, there's a triangle that is on the bottom right of that rhombus and it's facing like the top left corner.
554400	564400	And then the other triangle is connected to like a bigger shape and it's pointing to the top right.
564400	593400	On the bottom left is also like a triangle pointing up. Yeah. Okay, yeah.
593400	596400	Okay.
