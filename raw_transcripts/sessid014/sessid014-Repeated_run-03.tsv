54000	62000	This is this room, or the, um, gun, or the telephone, a thing coming out of it.
69000	74000	Okay, this is the horse and the legs, uh, square, uh, kind of.
85000	98000	Okay, this is, uh, the one I described as, um, the girl sitting down with the skirt, uh, in, to the right. She has legs, uh, a downward facing triangle is her legs down to the bottom right.
99000	109000	And her skirt is a big triangle, a sling coming out of her back, and she's facing to the right. She has a upright head, upright diamond head.
111000	114000	Um, yeah, basically, yeah.
114000	132000	Okay, this is the guy sitting down to, uh, go down the wall to the right, and he has his head, uh, pointed, shifted to the left a little bit.
132000	135000	Could he, I'm sorry, could he be a little bit louder?
135000	142000	Okay, sorry.
142000	144000	Yeah, of course.
144000	154000	Okay, sorry about that. Uh, so he is sitting with his back to the wall to the right. He's sitting down, um, his feet are a triangle.

173000	191000	Okay, this is the hard to describe one, uh, small triangle pointing to the left head, and this thing is carrying a square.
191000	196000	Um, and, yeah, the square is to the bottom.
196000	218000	Okay, this is the arabesque dance. Um, he said there was two arms pointed to the left, and to the right there is a triangle.
218000	243000	Okay, this is the square pushing the triangle off the clip to the left of the clip. It's very jagged. Uh, to the right, it's not as jagged, but the triangle is probably still going to get hurt. Um, yeah.
243000	262000	This is a hard to describe. It's symmetrical at the top, and at the bottom it has a thing jutting out to the right. Um, jagged at the top. Symmetrical and jagged at the top.

337000	355000	Okay, this is the symmetrical hard to describe figure with a trapezoid cut out of it. Um, also looks like an upside down trapezoid with two parallel curves.
355000	371000	Okay, this is the scuba diver or pinch with top hat. I kinda like the thing about that. Um, with the jetpack too as well.
371000	390000	This is, uh, the telephone pole with two speakers or a bamboo shoot with spiky stuff. Very vertical. Um, and yeah.
