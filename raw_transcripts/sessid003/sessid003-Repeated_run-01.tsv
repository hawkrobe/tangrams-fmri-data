100560	115560	This guy is, like, running to the left, and his head is bouncing on top.
115560	117560	Yeah, there you go.
117560	118560	Yeah.
118560	120560	Oh my goodness, we're killing it.
120560	131560	Um, this is, like, a weird dog thing, but there's two of these.
131560	138560	It's the one that looks more like a dog, maybe, and less like a horse.
138560	143560	It has, like, a completely flat, like, square butt.
143560	145560	Oh, I got it.
145560	146560	Yeah.
146560	152560	Yeah.
152560	155560	This is like that game Codenames a little.
155560	157560	Yeah.
157560	159560	Oh, this is the shitting duck.
159560	173560	Yes.
173560	180560	This is like the other dog-horse figure, but this one has, like, a tail that sticks up to the right.
180560	182560	Yeah.
182560	191560	Oh my god, I'm so good at this.
191560	199560	This guy is, like, oh, this is the one, okay, it's kind of, like, holding a bull or something to the right,
199560	206560	but it has, like, two connected diamond heads on top, like, one on top of the other.
206560	208560	Oh.
208560	209560	And...
209560	212560	Does it look like they're, like, on their knees?
212560	226560	Yeah, it does, yeah. Yeah, yay.
226560	232560	This one is kind of similar to the one we just did, but, like, it looks like their knees are bent instead of sitting,
232560	234560	and there's only one diamond head.
234560	235560	I see.
236560	238560	Yeah.
238560	250560	Yeah.
250560	252560	This is the fountain that you want.
252560	255560	Aw.
255560	257560	Maybe I wanted my front yard.
257560	268560	Maybe you get two.
268560	273560	This dude is the one that's, like, looking down with, like, two...
273560	277560	He's got, like, a headdress on with, like, two big triangles.
277560	281560	I don't remember how you described it, but his head is, like, a square,
281560	284560	and then there's, like, two big triangles protruding from the top.
284560	286560	He looks like a rabbit, right?
286560	287560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
287560	289560	All right.
289560	292560	Poor Pugs Bunny.
292560	299560	He looks so sad.
299560	301560	Oh, this is the little guy.
301560	305560	I think he said he was riding a Chihuahua, except there's two of those.
305560	312560	So this is the one where, like, the person kind of looks like he's, like, lying alongside, like, on top.
312560	314560	There's, like, a...
314560	316560	Is he looking down or looking up?
316560	319560	He's looking up.
319560	330560	Yeah.
330560	335560	Um, this is the one that kind of looks like a TV stand, almost.
335560	336560	It's, like, sideways.
336560	337560	Oh, yeah.
337560	342560	It's, like, a big view on a triangle.
342560	353560	Yeah.
353560	357560	Okay, this is the other little guy riding a Chihuahua, but he's looking down,
357560	360560	and his tail thing is pointing up.
360560	361560	Yeah.
361560	363560	He's not enjoying it.
363560	368560	No.
368560	371560	This guy kind of looks like he's dancing.
371560	377560	Um, he's got, like, his arm out to the right and his knee out to the left,
377560	381560	but his knee is, like, bent back and inwards,
381560	386560	and his body is a square basically on the, like, on the left half.
386560	387560	Okay.
387560	399560	Karate guy.
399560	403560	This one kind of looks like a bear to me or, like, a bird or something.
403560	407560	It's, like, either two distinct legs, but then the body is just, like, a big block,
407560	413560	and then there's, like, a little square that looks like a backpack or something kind of.
413560	416560	And the head is, like, a bead.
416560	418560	We haven't done this one yet.
418560	421560	Oh.
421560	427560	He's, like, standing on one leg, and one leg is up and to the left,
427560	429560	and he's facing to the left.
429560	433560	He's kind of, like, looking down, and there's, like, a block.
433560	436560	There's, like, a square on top of his, like, shoulders.
436560	437560	Hey.
437560	438560	Yay.
438560	440560	We did do this one.
440560	441560	We did?
441560	443560	Yeah, it's the guy with the smelly towel.
443560	445560	Oh.
