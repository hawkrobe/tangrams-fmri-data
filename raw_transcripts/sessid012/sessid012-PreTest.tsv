0	7440	Thank you.
30000	55920	Okay, so what I see is a square slightly rotated at the top, probably about 45 degrees and three
56000	62640	parallelograms. So like one really big one right under the square and then two parallelograms
62640	68640	kind of like reflected. They kind of look like arms so it's like if you imagine a person
69840	74720	waving up so it's like two parallelograms as their arms and then you've got a big one kind
74720	82880	of like a body and then the head is like a slightly rotated square and the head is like
82960	88000	it's not directly at the center of the big parallelogram so it's kind of leaning
88720	95840	or it's kind of closer to the left. So think of it like two arms going up and then like
96960	104560	the body but then the head is closer to like the left. I don't know if that made sense.
105520	111760	Okay, we're like trying to narrow down. Let's see.
114000	116160	Okay, so you said the head is to the left?
117280	123840	Yeah, so it's like slightly rotated and it's like it'll be closer to your left so there's like
123840	130080	two parallelograms that are like arms I guess and the head will be closer to the left parallelogram.
130800	134320	Okay, does it look like its arms are kind of raised up?
135680	140800	Uh, a little louder. I can hear you. Oh sorry, does it look like the arms are raised up?
141520	146880	Yeah, it's like think of it like there's a yelling hooray or something and they have
146880	172720	both their arms up. Okay, so the top is like a triangle with the long side of the triangle
172720	182160	facing right and the like pointy end of it at the left and it's so it's like it's a vertical
184080	190400	and then right under that is like a bigger triangle but this one isn't vertical. The
190400	199760	hypotenuse is like diagonal so it's like a small triangle and then a bigger triangle
200320	206960	that kind of looks like the body then there's a rectangle right under it. Everything is kind
206960	211840	of vertical I'd say and then at the although at the bottom is like a trapezoid.
213280	218640	Does it look like a person reading a book? Low-key, yes, yes, yes, low-key yeah. Okay.
218960	241040	Okay, so this is fully symmetric. It's a trapezoid with the longer side on the top and the shorter
241040	246800	side at the bottom and then there's like two parallelograms on top of it. Does it look like
246800	256880	a crab? Yes, a crab. I am not doing this right.
262240	270320	Okay, this is like a guy he's like walking like casually walking so it's like these are like two
270400	278640	triangles. Wait, does it look like his arm is pointed to the left? Oh gosh. Oh no. It
278640	282880	accidentally pressed it. I meant to press the different thing. I'm so sorry. You're good.
287280	296320	Okay, this looks like a dog. Wait, wait, don't click yet. The dog and like its feet are like
296320	304320	lined up. So like one of the feet could be a trapezoid and the other one a parallelogram?
304320	311360	Yes, yes, yes. I'm so scared of pressing the wrong button. No, no, you got it. There we go.
312000	312400	Yes.
318640	320240	Oh, sorry. Okay.
322640	333440	Um, all right. Sorry. The head is a square that is like 40 at 45 degrees. So like,
334400	341840	um, how do we describe it? The bottom is like a triangle. It's like two triangles with
342720	346240	a rectangle at the center. Upside down Christmas tree.
348000	354640	Uh, I can't, I can't hear you. Upside down Christmas tree. I don't think it looked maybe.
354640	359200	Not really. Wait, no, it doesn't really look like a Christmas tree. Okay, so it's not that one.
359600	368240	So the, the head is like a side, it's like a diagonal square, I guess. And then I think
368240	375840	there's a diagonal square right under it. Triangle on the right. Uh, rectangle under
376640	384240	the second diagonal square. And then the bottom part of it is like pretty relatively wide. So
384240	391520	it's like, maybe someone is like feeling down. I, the best way to put it, I don't know. Okay.
393840	394640	Take a guess.
398560	403440	So the person who's kneeling, would you say that their feet are in the air
404000	406960	or that their feet are firmly planted beneath their skirt?
407920	412480	Um, their feet are kind of in the air. Okay.
418960	420240	Yeah, sorry.
429200	436480	Okay, it's another person like thing, but it's like definitely running, but it only has one foot.
437520	439280	Oh, that's hilarious. It's like a skirt.
443680	448640	Let's see. It looks like they're running like very fast.
451520	457440	But there's one foot and it's like the foot that's forward. We are killing this. Yeah.
458400	467760	Oh, geez. Okay. Uh, it's like a person. So there's like the square head. Okay. But then the bottom
467760	478720	is like a rectangle with like a very thin trapezoid under it. So like maybe it's like a guy. He's like
478720	485760	giving a speech. So he's like at one. He's at like that, you know, he's like, I don't know.
486640	493600	He's at like that. What's it called? Like he's standing in front of a behind a pillar or something
493600	499520	and he's like giving a speech out to a bunch of people. So that's what it looks like. Okay.
499520	506080	His body is literally just a rectangle, but like a thin one, right? Yeah. But then like the bottom
506080	513440	is like a fat rectangle. So it kind of looks like a pedestal. I don't know. And the bottom
513440	519280	is just a thin trapezoid. So I've narrowed it down to two. Okay. Um,
521120	531040	does it, could you make the argument that it looks like a toilet or a graduate? Yeah, yeah, sure.
532160	539280	The toilet or the graduate? Toilet or what? Toilet or graduate? Uh, I think toilet.
539280	558960	Oh, it's, it's like a dude on a, on a, on a plane, but it's like,
560480	564480	it's like a paper plane. Um, there's like a little,
565040	570720	uh, what's it called? You know, the thing on the back of the plane that like makes it aerodynamic
570720	576720	and stuff. The tails? Yeah. Yeah. There's like a triangle. It's like a triangle tail, but it's
576720	583520	like, it looks like it's not sticking onto the rest of it. It's probably like very close. Um,
584320	590720	the body of the plane is like, it's a trapezoid and it looks like there's a guy kind of kneeling
590720	602320	his head down on the plane. And then, yeah. Easy. What in the world? We got this.
605280	612880	Okay. This is definitely a house. I think that should be all you need. It's really a house with
612880	630160	like a chimney looking thing. Yeah. What the? Uh, this is weird. Um, the top is like two triangles.
630960	639680	Okay. Uh, yeah. And then the body is like another triangle with a rectangle under it.
640400	642480	There's a parallelogram under that. Yeah.
652080	658320	Okay. There's a head that is like the rotated square, but this one doesn't really look like
658320	665920	a person because it's, it's really wide. The bottom is like a trapezoid and the top is also
666000	672560	like a trapezoid of the body and the middle is like a massive square. Yeah.
680160	686400	This one's really simple. So it's, it's like a person again. So there's the head, uh, tilted
687520	693440	right under that. There's a triangle under that. There's a rectangle and the bottom is like,
694400	700800	it looks like two trapezoids like flip so that the longer ends line up and then
702560	705280	all the way at the bottom is like the shorter side of the trapezoid.
707920	715840	It looks, it looks pretty simple. Maybe, maybe it's like someone's sitting, but like sitting facing
715840	722800	you. Oh golly. The body is literally just a rectangle.
725680	733120	And there's nothing really like protruding right or left. Not much. Is it giving like ghosty
733120	744000	graduate energy? Um, kind of. Um, it's, it's really simple. Like you could probably classify
744160	752160	like four shapes. So like square on top, trapezoid, rectangle, and then trapezoid, trapezoid.
753280	757440	Trapezoid, rectangle, trapezoid, trapezoid. Okay. So that's definitely not it.
763120	763840	Repeat that.
763840	772960	Okay. So you said square head.
773680	788240	Yeah. Square head. Then it's like, uh, uh, it's like a very, it's a trapezoid. It's not a triangle,
788240	792560	but like the top part of the trapezoid is pretty thin. So low key looks like a triangle.
793840	800240	Oh my gosh. Okay. We're so looking at the wrong one. Um, and under that it's just like a big
800240	808240	rectangle. It's like, think of someone facing you and sitting on like a seat, but, but without
808240	815200	the seat. And this guy doesn't have any legs. Wait, but it's like, is it a trapezoid at the
815200	821600	top or a square? It's a square, but right under the square. It's like a very, it's a trapezoid
821600	830400	right under the square. This should not be this hard. Wait, wait, but the trapezoid under the
830400	837680	square. It's like the top part of it is it's like small. It's very small. So it's almost like a
837680	844800	triangle, but I don't think it's a triangle. Okay. We're doing process of elimination at this point.
845440	858400	Okay. Okay. So you said square trapezoid. Yeah. What's the next thing? It's a big, big square
860240	861280	slash rectangle.
864560	869920	And then it's way, it's a parallelogram under that. It's not a trapezoid
869920	879200	trapezoid. Square trapezoid rectangle, parallelogram, lift trapezoid.
881520	889440	And it looks simple like compared to the other ones. See, cause the only simple, oh my gosh.
889520	899840	Okay. So there's one that looks like it's a square triangle, triangle,
901680	908720	and then a weird parallelogram, but that's too much going from top to bottom.
909360	914880	But then if I look at the simplest one here, it reminds me of a giraffe,
915600	921840	but that's not what you're describing at all. I don't think it's a giraffe. Okay.
922880	930800	So then the next simplest one that I see, it's like, it looks kind of like a submarine
931840	938320	with a square on top of it. Is the square on top rotated? Yes.
938960	947200	Uh, okay. No, no, no, it's not that one. No. Okay. So then the next simple one that I see,
947920	954720	it's, it's almost like they have their hands up in the air, but they're laying on their back.
954720	960240	It looks like, okay, you know, those murder outlines, it looks like that, but like for a ghost.
961520	964720	I don't think it's that one. Okay. They're definitely all laid out.
964720	971040	Process of elimination. We got this. Um, okay. So the next simple one I see,
971840	977600	no, that's not it. Cause you said it has a square at the top. Which one is this?
978560	986960	Okay. The bottom, like the bottom of the picture, the lowest shape is a trapezoid.
986960	995520	And you said it looks like they're sitting. Well, okay. Think of it like it's a trapezoid
996320	1000240	with, and the longer side of the trapezoid is like a parallelogram.
1001680	1004800	There's one on top of it, like a parallelogram right on top of it.
1007040	1014720	We are guessing. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It was the one I thought of. That's devastating.
1014720	1027440	Sorry. Okay. Um, this is a big parallelogram up top. Then at the bottom left of the parallelogram,
1027440	1035280	there's a little rectangle going down. What does it look like a security camera? Yeah.
1035280	1042400	Yeah. Nice. Nice.
1047600	1050880	Tank. Oh. Tank one.
1053840	1055840	Yay. Yay.
1055840	1070560	Okay. This is like a swan. It's, it's like a swan. And then the bottom left is like a triangle
1071840	1075520	that is like kind of separated from the rest of it. Yeah.
1075520	1089040	This is like a person kneeling down, uh, maybe to like give a prayer or something
1089600	1092800	and their feet are not sticking out. We talked about this one.
1096320	1098000	Okay. We love the recall.
1098000	1123920	Uh, this is the house with a big chimney. Okay. The bottom is a big rectangle. Then
1123920	1129840	there's a narrow rectangle on the left side of this big rectangle on top.
1129840	1132560	And then the absolute top is like, uh, yeah.
1140000	1148640	It's like, it's a weird, weird rabbit with like two triangle ears up top. It's, yeah, it's like two.
1148640	1156480	Okay. Oh, we need it.
1159440	1166160	Uh, it's a guy like sitting down. He looks a little sad. He's like,
1167040	1171120	he's sitting facing the left. So his legs are out.
1178960	1191440	Okay. It's, uh, it's weird. It's a triangle on the left. Maybe you can think of it like
1191440	1199760	a seesaw, but it's like a tilted seesaw. Okay. Um, basically just take a seesaw and,
1200480	1208960	uh, put it like 45 degree angle and on the seesaw. Yeah.
1217120	1221200	Okay. This is, this might be like a squirrel or something.
1222800	1228320	Uh, it's some kind of animal that the head is the head is a triangle.
1229200	1232480	Okay. There's like a tail on it. There's definitely a tail.
1234480	1240880	Um, the feet are both triangles. Yeah. That's a squirrel. Okay. My bad.
1244560	1252400	Um, okay. This is a dude. He looks like he's holding an upside down triangle. He has like,
1253120	1255120	Oh, shoot.
1265760	1271200	Um, it's a guy. He has like his arms out. His arms are up, but they're like kind of
1271920	1281360	to the right and to the left. Okay. Yeah. Um, his feet are like behind it, but they're like
1281360	1293360	poking out of the left side. And there's like, uh, it kind of looks like there's a missing area
1294240	1298400	in his body because it's like a triangle. One of his arms is like a triangle.
1299120	1305680	So there's like a little white space in it. Okay. Is it, does it look like the person who's doing
1305680	1308560	yoga? Uh, a little bit. Yeah.
1319200	1326240	Oh, sorry. You're good. Okay. This is, it's, it's a guy, but it could be,
1327680	1333840	it could be something else. Um, it looks like, so his head is a trapezoid and it looks like
1333920	1339920	it might be like a monster, like trampling around and it looks like he's holding like a flag.
1341360	1345680	Ooh. Okay. The flag is like, he's like carrying it over his shoulder.
1346640	1353680	He's definitely like trampling around, making a mess. Yeah. His feet are both trapezoids.
1353760	1361280	Okay. So this person, do they have a wide stance?
1362880	1366720	Wide stance. They're, they're walking to the left.
1367600	1373680	Walking to the left. And one of their feet is like up. Like it looks like it's about to come.
1373680	1381520	It's coming down. Okay. And so you said square and then immediately below that,
1381520	1386080	is it a parallelogram? Uh, where do you see the square?
1388080	1394320	Um, like it's the shape that's at the top, like the highest one. The top right?
1395280	1402880	No, just it's the highest one. Uh, yeah.
1402880	1407680	Yeah. And then immediately attached to it. It's like.
1408880	1414320	It's like it's a square, but then to the left of the square, there's also a trapezoid and
1414320	1421680	they're kind of odd level. Okay. They're both like not straight though. They're both like slightly
1421680	1428640	tilted. Does it look like, is the head facing the right? Uh, the head is facing the left.
1428640	1433840	It honestly like doesn't look like a guy. It looks more like, uh, some kind of creature.
1434960	1437440	Oh gosh. With like a pointy beak.
1439920	1443360	Nice. Like think, yeah, yes.
1451040	1457520	Um, think of a guy, but he has a tail. And the tail, at the end of the tail,
1457520	1465280	it's like a triangle. Oh, his body is two massive triangles. Does it look like he's doing yoga?
1466880	1470800	Uh, you could consider that. Yeah. There we go.
1470800	1488320	Uh, okay. Uh, this guy is at graduation. He's got his arms out in front of him.
1489920	1499680	Uh, his feet are just a trapezoid, a thin trapezoid. Um,
1500560	1503840	yeah.
1508720	1512160	Okay. This is a guy running to the left.
1514800	1517840	There shouldn't be any other ones that look like that.
1529680	1537840	Uh, this is like a symmetric upside down Christmas tree.
1539840	1541840	I've been waiting for this one.
1542160	1561920	Okay. Um, this is, it doesn't really look like a person. Uh, the top is a square,
1563120	1571360	but it's not like on anything. Um, the two farthest right, uh, shapes are both triangles.
1572080	1580720	But one is at the bottom. One is like near the top. The bottom left is a flat, like parallelogram.
1582640	1588640	And then the main, like, I guess body is more rectangular,
1591120	1595600	but I guess it could also be a parallelogram. Okay.
1595600	1600480	So you said the first shape is a square?
1601360	1608000	The top, it's like the top middle is a square, but it's not super connected to anything.
1608720	1613040	So it's kind of like hanging out on its own. Oh my gosh.
1617840	1624240	Um, and then the bottom is like a relatively big parallelogram.
1626000	1635040	And then the far, I think this will help, the far to right, uh, objects are both like separated triangles.
1643280	1645360	Square that's not connected to anything.
1648080	1652480	What's that? You said it's a square that's not connected to anything?
1653360	1657520	Um, it's, it's touching a parallelogram, but like barely.
1663360	1666080	I think look for two triangles that are like
1668080	1672080	barely connected to the rest of the figure and they're both to the far right.
1674000	1676080	One is near the bottom. One is near the top.
1678000	1678500	Okay.
1678500	1682820	On the right side.
1684660	1691540	Oh my gosh. Uh, oh no, that was, that was close though.
1692740	1694580	That was a hot, that's on me.
1696180	1703140	Okay. This one kind of looks like a flower or diamond or something more like a flower.
1703860	1708020	So it's like a few triangles and then like a bigger triangle in the center.
1709140	1711140	And then the bottom is like, yeah.
1719060	1723540	Uh, this is a guy facing to the right.
1724420	1729060	So his arms, if you consider them arms, they're like out.
1729060	1734180	And then one of his legs is like contorted a little bit backwards.
1734900	1745220	So it looks like he's doing like a little break dance move or something.
1751140	1759460	Um, this one looks like it's some kind of aircraft up in the air.
1759460	1764340	It's like a guy in this guy sitting down. There's a lot of triangles.
1767140	1771780	Um, I think it's the only one that looks like any kind of like aircraft.
1772580	1773080	Okay.
1775780	1780820	Could you say that the bottom portion kind of looks like a fox or like some sort of animal?
1781380	1791620	Um, like sort of. So the bottom is like a parallelogram and a triangle.
1799700	1801140	Oh yeah, that does look like a fox.
1803620	1808740	This looks like a cactus, sort of. It's very narrow and tall.
1809460	1813060	Say less. As soon as you said cactus, I knew.
1825460	1836100	Oh, uh, think of like, maybe, uh, it's like, it's an animal that is like very,
