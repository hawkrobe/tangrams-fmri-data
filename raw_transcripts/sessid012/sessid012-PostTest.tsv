0	19000	Okay, here we go.
19000	25000	Camel?
25000	35000	Wait, what?
35000	37000	Oh, I had my hands one button off.
37000	39000	That's actually so based.
39000	41000	Oh my god.
41000	45000	No, you're so good. I was like, where's the camel in the tank?
45000	49000	This is the wide bodied one.
49000	51000	Okay.
51000	54000	No, the streak is gone.
54000	65000	We still have the eight.
65000	81000	The house.
81000	98000	This one.
98000	114000	The factory.
114000	128000	The person walking to the left.
128000	142000	The toilet.
142000	157000	The flower.
157000	173000	The tank.
173000	186000	The cactus.
186000	202000	Person arguing, their hands are in the air.
202000	220000	Person who's kneeling, it looks like they're praying, but their feet are in the air.
220000	238000	Same mindset, except this time the feet are planted firmly on the ground.
238000	254000	Break dancing.
254000	269000	Person with their arms stretched out, kneeling.
269000	284000	Airplane.
284000	288000	The weird scale, seesaw.
288000	289000	Seesaw?
289000	303000	Yeah.
303000	318000	The person sitting down without any arms.
318000	334000	This one looks like a house.
334000	340000	A person who looks like they're about to take a running start to go to the right.
340000	348000	Their arm is a trapezoid that's kind of elevated.
348000	355000	They're about to take a right?
355000	358000	They're facing the right.
358000	363000	They're facing the left.
363000	386000	And they're the only ones that look like they're about to go into motion.
386000	408000	This is the squirrel that does not look like a squirrel.
408000	418000	That's a squirrel.
418000	434000	A rabbit?
434000	438000	That's a rabbit.
438000	442000	How do I even describe that?
442000	445000	Is that weird?
445000	449000	It's weird, but not the one that we've been calling weird.
449000	456000	It looks like a parent holding the hand like a child.
456000	458000	Are both the hands up?
458000	460000	Sorry?
460000	463000	Are both the hands up?
463000	466000	This one has zero arms.
466000	473000	The bigger one has the body of a triangle, and then attached to it is a square head.
473000	480000	But to the left side, if you pretend like they're holding hands, the head of the smaller one is a triangle.
480000	485000	The hypotenuse is facing upwards.
485000	489000	And then the foot is like a trapezoid.
489000	492000	Are they holding a glass of wine or something?
492000	505000	Yes.
505000	522000	This is the graduate that doesn't look like a toilet.
522000	528000	This one also gets rabbit energy, but not the rabbit that we've been saying.
528000	530000	Rabbit 2.0?
530000	542000	Rabbit 2.0.
542000	546000	The person who's sitting on the ground, their head kneeled.
546000	557000	There we go.
557000	571000	It's a weird shape.
571000	574000	Aircraft?
574000	577000	But not our aircraft.
577000	588000	Aircraft 2.0.
588000	591000	Upside down tree.
591000	592000	Upside down tree?
592000	604000	Yeah.
604000	606000	Security camera.
606000	620000	Okay.
620000	622000	Yoga?
622000	624000	What is it?
624000	638000	Yoga?
638000	643000	It looks like a dog sin.
643000	644000	Like a dog?
644000	656000	Yeah.
656000	670000	Crab?
670000	684000	Is there a person walking to the right?
684000	685000	Ooh.
685000	686000	Okay.
686000	688000	A person kneeling to the left.
688000	691000	It looks as though they have a book.
691000	708000	And they have a little triangle on the top of their head.
708000	711000	Can we call this weird shape 2.0?
711000	719000	This is a head connected to a trapezoid that is pointing to the right.
719000	724000	Connected to another trapezoid, but this one is pointed to the left.
724000	725000	Okay.
725000	734000	Then connected to another trapezoid that the long side is facing the base of this photo.
734000	739000	And then a weird triangle connected, yeah.
739000	765000	I don't even know what to call that.
769000	780000	Okay.
780000	782000	Okay.
