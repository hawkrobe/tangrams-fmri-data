0	18120	Okay, the left side of the figure, on the far left side it's a large triangular cutout,
18120	23120	and then on the far right side, far upper right side, there is a triangle connected
23120	35560	at one point that faces right. Sorry, I need a little bit more. Okay, in the center middle
35560	40640	of the figure there's a rhombus that's connected at one point to a right triangle that's connected
40640	49440	to the central part of the figure. The bottom right is a right triangle facing downward.
49440	61040	I think it's the only figure with a left side is a large triangular cutout with a
61040	81480	peak facing right. Oh, okay, I see, and there's a rhombus head. Yeah. Okay. Okay, it looks like
81480	88720	someone doing a single leg squat. The left side is a triangular cutout. The left side is a triangular
88880	106720	cutout. Okay, rhombus head and parallelogram extending to the bottom right. Okay, it looks
106720	114480	like the letter I. There's a small triangle about three quarters of the way up facing right,
114960	121680	and then another small triangle at the bottom facing right. The left side has a trapezoidal
121680	128400	cutout. So it's like an I, and then there's like additional shapes connected on the bottom half,
128400	131360	with the left side being a trapezoid cutout.
145760	154880	Looks like a sphynx or a dog facing left. The bottom left is a parallelogram
155680	159600	to the right of that. There's a large white space that's kind of like a parallelogram,
159600	169440	but the right side has an additional triangle facing right. The center of the figure is a
169440	192160	large rectangle on the left. It looks like someone kneeling with a rhombus head,
193120	198000	and then on the left side there's a parallelogram cutout.
200000	203360	On the right side, the cutout is a large triangle with a peak facing left.
206640	209920	The top of the figure is a rhombus head with a rhombus directly below it.
222160	229120	It looks like a person leaning against a wall facing left, rhombus head,
232240	236480	and a person hugging their knees. Okay, sitting on the ground.
236480	256640	The top of the figure is two triangles that look like bunny ears. They're both connected at one
256640	262400	point to a large triangle that faces right. The base of the figure is a parallelogram
262480	266400	with the point of contact being the base of the parallelogram, so two points in a line.
267520	272720	On the middle left, there's a rhombus that's connected at one point to a triangle.
273680	279040	Okay, those squares are only connected at two points to the whole figure.
279600	281040	Okay, oh correct.
295040	302080	Okay, there's a rhombus head, but it's more on the upper left.
302720	307680	The base is a parallelogram. Okay, so sorry, scratch all that, start from the base.
307680	311440	It's a parallelogram with a long side on the ground. To the right of the parallelogram,
311440	319760	there is a white cutout of a right triangle with the hypotenuse facing up left. To the right of
319760	325520	that, there is another right triangle in black connected at one point. The center of the figure
325520	344560	is like a large rectangle. Okay, it looks like another person kneeling. It's the one with the
344560	350320	triangle on the bottom left, the cutout triangle bottom left, and then on the right side there's
350320	354240	a triangle cutout, but the peak is facing right. Rhombus head.
356320	360560	And the right, the cutout on the right of the triangle is slightly higher than the cutout on
360560	364160	the left? Yes. Got it.
373840	379680	It's the person with the two small triangle feet. Looks like a man with a square head facing right
379680	383520	with one arm extended downward. Okay, and like the top hat? Yes.
397840	401360	The base is a large rectangle with two triangles that are,
402080	406400	their bases are completely connected to the short sides of the rectangle. There's a triangle,
407040	410640	so in the middle of the figure, there's a triangle facing upward with a rhombus
410640	428480	connected at only one point. Okay, starting from the bottom right, there is a
429280	435120	small triangle, not equilateral, a small triangle facing downward that's connected
435760	441360	by sort of like a small pipe to the base, the central base of the figure, which is a large
441360	450640	triangle. Then the top of the figure is a rhombus head connected at one point to an upside down
450640	454560	right triangle where the hypotenuse is facing the bottom right of the figure.
454560	464800	The right side of the cutout in this figure on the right side is a large trapezoid where the
465520	476080	top of the trapezoid is facing left and is, yeah, the left side. I think I got it. On the
476080	480880	bottom right, there's a tiny, tiny triangle. Yes, but it's connected by like a small rectangular
480880	498480	portion. This looks like a flamingo jumping to the right. There's a small triangle at the bottom
498480	519520	left connected at only one point to the rest of the figure. Okay, it somewhat resembles a person
520080	528320	with one foot on the ground. The feet are triangles, but the upper half of each triangle
528320	534240	is connected to a rectangle. The other foot is sort of raised in the air. In the upper right of
534240	540560	the figure, there's a rhombus head. Slightly to the left of that, there's a triangular cutout.
540560	557040	Okay, it looks like, okay, there's bunny ears again. They're connected to a rhombus.
558080	563600	That rhombus is connected to the tip of a large right triangle. That comprises pretty much the
563600	568960	whole figure except the right triangle at the bottom right. There's another triangle that
568960	575200	intersects like 30% of the right triangle. Okay, it's like a bunny facing right. Yeah.
587200	591600	Okay, it looks like a top view of a crab. The base is an upside-down trapezoid.
592560	598560	Oh, sorry. I accidentally clicked the... Sorry, I knew that that was it. I hit the wrong button.
603360	605840	It looks like a farmhouse with a chimney on the right side.
606320	624960	Okay, it looks like a person with a rhombus head. There are two legs that are
624960	630560	slightly different shapes. It looks like their legs are stretched out in both directions.
631360	634320	And on the left side, it looks like a foot facing upward.
634960	641280	On the right side, it's just a parallelogram. Okay, I think I got it.
660880	671280	Okay.
671280	672560	Yeah, it feels good. No problems.
675120	678320	Good. I'm a little uncomfortable, but I think I just need to move a little bit.
684880	687840	Just like my right arm is just a little uncomfortable.
691520	696560	Got it. Can I just leave my left hand down? Yeah, okay. I think I'm all set then.
700160	700400	Okay.
709120	717280	Yeah, I think I was like kind of holding my arm up.
720560	721280	Okay.
