start	end	text
30000	41240	Do I start? Okay, uh, this looks like a dog, and, um, it has a tail, and it's facing to
41240	50200	our left, and, um, all I can really say about it, it has, like, a little jut out in its
50200	57200	left leg, from our perspective, and the right leg is just a triangle, if that makes sense.
57200	61200	Okay, um, I think it does. I think I know which one you're talking about.
61200	62200	Okay, great.
67200	68200	Yeah.
72200	79200	Okay, uh, um, this one looks like a person lying down, but kind of also in a sitting
79200	89200	up position, and they're, um, kind of like they're lying against a wall, and they have
89200	95200	like one foot, or I guess both feet, but they're like parallel, so we can only see one, if
95200	96200	that makes sense.
96200	97200	I know which one you're talking about.
97200	98200	Okay, great.
98200	99200	Like a square head, right?
99200	100200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
100200	101200	Okay, yeah.
110200	115200	This one really just looks like a mess of shapes to me.
115200	125200	Um, it looks a bit like a short and wide dancer, dancing, um, the famous square head.
125200	131200	The square is fairly, like, parallel to the ground, if that makes sense, like it's not,
131200	133200	Hey, disregard that part.
133200	144200	But, um, their left hand, from our perspective, is a bit bigger than their right hand, um.
144200	147200	I think I know which one you're talking about.
147200	148200	Okay, great.
148200	149200	I think.
149200	152200	Wow, that's impressive, nice.
152200	154200	Yes, okay.
154200	155200	Great.
155200	165200	Um, this is also a dancer, but it's the one where they're standing on one leg, straight
165200	170200	up, and they have both arms kind of extended to the left.
170200	172200	I know which one, yeah.
172200	173200	Yeah.
173200	174200	Yeah, okay.
185200	189200	Okay, this is also kind of a mess of shapes.
189200	193200	Yeah, this one does not look like a person to me, like, at all.
193200	198200	Um, there's, I might just, like, give some geometric descriptions.
198200	203200	So, like, in the center, but closer to the top a little bit, but mostly in the center,
203200	209200	there's the square, and the square is, like, in the diamond shape, almost entirely.
209200	216200	And then below the square, there's a triangle that connects to the right corner of the
216200	222200	square, pretty much only, and then that triangle, like, extends downward into, like, the main
222200	226200	body of the shape, if that makes sense.
226200	233200	Um, and also on the right of this shape, there's a smaller triangle that's coming off of the
233200	238200	main body of the shape that's, like, barely touching the rest of the shape, just by the
238200	239200	curve.
239200	242200	I think I know which one you're talking about.
242200	243200	Okay.
243200	244200	Uh, down, sorry.
244200	245200	Wait, oh.
245200	246200	I, okay.
246200	247200	It was hard.
247200	248200	I clicked on the wrong one.
248200	249200	That was my bad.
249200	250200	I knew which one it was, though.
250200	251200	Okay, wow.
251200	252200	Damn.
252200	253200	Okay.
253200	262200	This one, uh, kind of looks like a person sitting down and kneeling, or, yeah, probably
262200	266200	kneeling and, like, praying or asking for alms or something.
266200	274200	And they have the diamond-shaped head, and also there's, like, what looks like a parallelogram
274200	280200	coming out of their back from the left, and then on the right is a random triangle that
280200	282200	doesn't really fit in.
282200	287200	But yeah, you have the person begging, and the parallelogram on the left and the triangle
287200	288200	on the right.
290200	291200	Got it.
291200	292200	Nice.
297200	303200	This one looks not like a person at all.
303200	305200	There's actually no square at all.
305200	310200	Um, it's hard to describe.
310200	315200	Can you picture, like, a diamond shape?
315200	316200	You know what I mean?
316200	321200	Like, if you see, like, one of those clipart pictures of a diamond that's, like, very cut
321200	324200	and, like, straight, if that makes sense?
324200	325200	Yeah.
325200	330200	You can also picture taking out a triangle from the bottom part of that diamond, and
330200	334200	also a trapezoid from the top part of the diamond.
334200	340200	So there's, like, a white trapezoid that's, like, in the negative space, and yeah, that's
340200	341200	what it looks like.
341200	343200	Is it the angry crab-looking one?
343200	344200	Yes, it does.
344200	345200	Okay.
345200	346200	Nice.
346200	347200	Got it.
356200	364200	This looks like a bird of some sort, like a goose or flamingo, and it's, like, wider
364200	368200	than it is tall, if that makes sense, and the bird is facing to the right.
368200	374200	It's got, like, a pretty long neck, and one of its feet is going out to the left a little
374200	375200	bit.
375200	376200	Got it.
376200	377200	I think.
377200	378200	Yeah, nice.
378200	379200	Yeah.
386200	392200	This one looks kind of like the Loch Ness Monster, if that makes sense.
392200	396200	Like, you've seen those, like, pictures of it, it's really blurry, and its, like, neck
396200	401200	is coming out of the water, and its neck is quite long, and it has, like, a square-ish
401200	405200	with a bit rectangular body, and it's facing to the left.
405200	406200	Yeah.
406200	407200	Got it.
407200	408200	Got it.
415200	422200	Um, this one could be interpreted as a person begging, but the body is way too, like, blocky
422200	424200	to be that, in my opinion.
424200	430200	So, to me, it looks like there's a cliff, actually, and then there's, like, a diamond
430200	433200	on top of the cliff, just chilling there.
435200	436200	If that makes sense.
436200	437200	I think so.
437200	439200	Great, yeah.
445200	456200	This one looks like a dog, like, quite stereotypical dog, and the main body part is, like, a complete
456200	458200	rectangle, and there's, yeah.
458200	459200	Got it.
459200	474200	This one is, like, a person that's, like, doing judo or karate or something, and, um,
474200	479200	they've kind of got their arms up, and, like, that's just, like, an interpretation, not,
479200	485200	it's not, like, what I see, if that makes sense, and their right leg, from our perspective,
485200	490200	is kind of, like, coming towards you, if you could use your imagination, their left
490200	498200	leg is back, and the diamond-shaped head is a little bit to the left of the entire picture,
498200	500200	and to the right.
500200	501200	Yeah, nice.
501200	502200	Got it.
502200	519200	Uh, this looks like maybe a scuba diver, so, like, definitely longer than it is wide,
519200	524200	and you see, like, the person, and there's two, like, triangles at the bottom that are,
524200	529200	like, the flippers, and then an arm coming out to the right, and then they have, like,
529200	531200	a backpack, yeah.
531200	545200	This one definitely looks like someone asking for food, or, like, having their hands out,
545200	550200	asking for something, and so it's, like, they're wearing a robe almost, and they have a diamond-shaped
550200	555200	head in the center, and their hands are coming out to the left, and their hands are, like,
555200	557200	robed, so they're, like, yeah.
557200	558200	Nice.
558200	564200	I thought priest for that one.
564200	565200	Oh, okay.
565200	567200	It kind of looks like a priest.
567200	568200	Yeah.
568200	573200	This one kind of looks like an animal that is in the water and swimming, but it's kind
573200	578200	of not, but to me it looks like an animal, and so it's kind of divided into two, where,
578200	582200	like, the left part is a little bit up, the right part is a little bit down, and there's,
582200	587200	like, a small connecting bit in the center, and then the head is in the left, and then
587200	588200	the feet are on the right.
588200	589200	Got it.
589200	590200	Got it.
590200	601200	Does it really look like a person?
601200	607200	To me it looks like a mountain range, where there's, like, a bigger mountain and then
607200	613200	a smaller mountain to the right, and then on that mountain there is a square that looks
613200	618200	like mostly a diamond, but not quite, and then from that square there's two triangles
618200	623200	coming out of the top of it.
623200	626200	I can keep going.
626200	627200	Yeah.
627200	631200	If you wanted to interpret it as a person, it would be, like, a person lying against
631200	637200	a wall completely, and then they're, like, they have their knees up, which is, like,
637200	639200	the second note that I was talking about before.
639200	642200	Oh, I pressed on the wrong one.
642200	643200	It's okay, no worries.
643200	645200	I know which one you were talking about, though.
645200	648200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
648200	655200	Okay, this one looks like someone dancing or maybe getting ready to fight you.
655200	661200	They have their, like, main body part is just a rectangle, mostly, and then they have their
661200	666200	left leg coming out, and then their, like, foot is up a little bit, and the right leg,
667200	672200	their leg is just completely down, so there's no foot, and then they have their, yeah.
672200	673200	Got it.
673200	682200	Yeah, great.
682200	687200	This one is a person begging or asking for food or something.
687200	694200	This looks more like a woman for some reason, and their arms are to the right, and then
694200	699200	their feet or maybe their dress is coming up from the left.
699200	704200	Got it.
704200	713200	Ooh, I don't know.
713200	721200	This one looks like a person floating to me, and almost like a ghost would float, but,
721200	727200	like, if the ghost was moving around so that their body was kind of trailing.
727200	730200	I know that is, like, a terrible description, I'm sorry.
730200	732200	Oh, okay.
732200	734200	Yeah, sorry.
734200	736200	I couldn't figure out how to describe this.
736200	739200	It kind of looks like a wine glass, like they're holding a wine glass.
739200	741200	Ooh, oh, I see it now.
741200	747200	Okay, well, this one looks like a flower, like the stem is coming from the right, like,
747200	755200	so the stem is going left, and then it opens up to the flower as it goes to the top.
755200	759200	Yeah.
759200	763200	It can be like a torch.
763200	766200	It also kind of looks like you started with the same diamond shape and cut out two triangles
766200	770200	from it, and then added something in the bottom.
770200	771200	Got it.
771200	773200	Like an angry claw hand.
773200	775200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
775200	782200	Nice.
782200	786200	Yeah, sorry, I'll try.
786200	792200	This one looks like you're sitting at a table with someone, and the table is a hexagon,
792200	798200	but the hexagon is way wider than it is tall, and then there's a person across from you
798200	800200	that's sitting, so you see a bit of a body.
800200	809200	Got it.
809200	812200	Okay.
812200	818200	This is definitely like a barn, and there's a barn, and there's like a door that's white
818200	822200	that's cut out, and then on the left of the barn there's like a storage silo or something,
822200	825200	but the silo has a triangle on top of it.
825200	836200	Got it.
836200	842200	This one is another person praying, or sorry, asking for food or something, and their head
842200	849200	of the diamond is up there, and they have their arms to the right, and their leg is
849200	852200	going down to the left of it.
852200	863200	Great.
863200	869200	This one looks like a person kind of raising the roof, if that makes sense, like they're
869200	874200	dancing and their body is going to the left, kind of like their body is shifting to the
874200	875200	left.
875200	876200	Yeah.
876200	877200	Nice.
877200	892200	Ooh, this one does not look like a person to me either.
892200	898200	The square is like not the head of the person, or it's not even a person, but not the head
898200	899200	at all.
899200	903200	It's like a little bit in the bottom left of the picture, but still mostly in the center,
903200	905200	so if you had to pick a corner it would be the bottom left.
905200	911200	And then there's like the main body to the right of that, that's kind of a bit tall,
911200	914200	but not rectangular, there's stuff coming off of it.
914200	922200	And the defining feature to me is that on top of that main blob body part are two triangles
922200	923200	that are coming out.
923200	924200	Yeah, nice.
924200	927200	It's like a rabbit playing soccer.
927200	930200	Okay, I see it, yeah.
930200	931200	Nice.
934200	935200	Ooh.
938200	945200	I'm imagining this one is like a dance fighter, like you see in those movies, and they're
945200	950200	kind of like life, I don't know, like they move around a lot, that's bad.
950200	957200	Anyway, their head is more square than it is diamond shaped, and it's going, it's a
957200	960200	bit to the left of the image, but not like that much left.
960200	965200	And then the leg, the person that's kind of like a big leg, to be honest, is going to
965200	966200	the left.
966200	967200	Yeah.
967200	968200	Got it.
977200	984200	This one is the person like just sitting there, this is the one that you, when I was talking
984200	986200	about the ghost, that's the one you picked.
986200	988200	Oh, okay.
990200	991200	Nice.
1001200	1006200	Okay, interesting, this is the person like kneeling down, but their arms are up so they
1006200	1011200	look like kind of happy, like they're, like they've just finished a pose or whatever,
1011200	1015200	like a break dancing routine, now they're like kneeling there with their arms up a bit,
1015200	1017200	and they're looking at you.
1017200	1022200	There's also like a little bit of white space, like in the middle, that's like this very
1022200	1025200	thin triangle, if that helps.
1029200	1034200	They kind of have like a foot coming up to the left a little bit, but it's like a very
1034200	1036200	small triangle foot.
1036200	1039200	I think I know what you're talking about now.
1039200	1040200	Uh, yeah.
1040200	1041200	Okay.
1041200	1042200	All right.
1042200	1043200	All good.
1044200	1045200	Okay.
1054200	1061200	Okay, I want you to imagine like a tree, so there's like a rectangle base for the trunk,
1061200	1067200	and then there's two like sets of leaves on either left or right.
1067200	1069200	Now, no, no, no, sorry.
1069200	1072200	I was going to say like flip the tree over.
1072200	1074200	Sorry, that's the best way I think of to like describe that.
1074200	1076200	No, you're good, you're good.
1079200	1083200	Okay, this is just a barn with a silo, so like the same as before, but no triangle on
1083200	1084200	top.
1084200	1085200	Uh, yeah.
1085200	1086200	Got it.
1086200	1087200	Nice.
1089200	1091200	Trying to be still.
1097200	1099200	Mmm.
1100200	1106200	Okay, this is similar to the people begging, but it doesn't quite look like a person in
1106200	1112200	that there's the diamond head, um, mostly in the center, a little bit to the right.
1112200	1118200	Then there's a rectangular body and a little triangle on the right that looks like it could
1118200	1122200	be hands, but then on the left there's another rectangle.
1122200	1123200	Oh.
1123200	1124200	Yeah.
1124200	1125200	I chose too quickly.
1125200	1126200	No, it's okay.
1126200	1127200	It's okay.
1127200	1128200	You're good.
1128200	1129200	Okay.
1133200	1139200	This is just straight up a shape, like there's no, there's no diamond at all, or there's
1139200	1146200	no square at all, I mean, and it looks like it could be like a radar gun that a cop uses
1146200	1148200	to like, yeah, nice.
1158200	1162200	This is also just straight up a shape, there's no square.
1162200	1170200	Uh, it kind of looks like you have a telephone with a really weird protrusion coming out
1170200	1172200	of the back of it.
1172200	1173200	Nice.
1173200	1174200	Okay.
1174200	1193200	This is like a kid, there's like a kid, um, who's kind of looking down and a bit to the
1193200	1200200	left, and they have a triangular foot to the left and they're holding the square in their
1200200	1203200	hands and looking down at it.
1203200	1204200	Nice.
1204200	1219200	Ooh, um, this is the one that we, that you chose when we got it wrong, when we got it
1219200	1227200	wrong earlier that's like mostly a rectangular, mostly a rectangular but not quite, like objects
1227200	1228200	in the middle.
1228200	1229200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1241200	1246200	Um, this one looks like an angel to me, and so like those wings coming out to the left
1246200	1254200	and then a square head, mostly square head, looking to the right, and then a foot coming
1254200	1261200	out to the left a bit, and then something like, almost like a tail also coming out
1261200	1263200	from the back on the left.
