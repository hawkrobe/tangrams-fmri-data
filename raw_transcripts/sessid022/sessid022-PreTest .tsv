0	16360	Okay, so this is the one with, like, the two square shapes that are, like, fused together,
16360	23000	and then there's, like, a little other square thing that's, like, coming out the top.
24000	30000	Okay, I think I know which one you mean. Does it kind of look like a swan facing left?
30000	41000	Um, no, not that one, I don't think. It's the one with, like, uh, it's like if you turned,
41000	47000	like, two squares with the vertex of each square facing down.
47000	48000	Oh, like, diamonds?
48000	49000	Yes.
49000	52000	Oh, I thought of that as, like, a spear pointing downwards.
52000	56000	Oh. Yeah, I guess it kind of looks like that.
56000	59000	Okay, so two diamonds and a square on top?
59000	60000	Yes.
60000	61000	Good.
66000	67000	Correct.
67000	68000	Okay.
72000	77000	Um, okay, so this one is, like, looks kind of like the weird guy who's, like, leaning
77000	84000	back and he has, like, one of his feet, like, pointed outward on one side and then his
84000	88000	head is leaning, like, on the other, in the other direction.
88000	89000	Yeah.
89000	92000	And then he has, like, a weird cape.
92000	100000	Yeah. Um, is the head more of a square or more of a diamond?
101000	108000	Uh, I don't know, really. It's...
108000	109000	Okay.
109000	110000	Hang on.
110000	112000	I think this one.
114000	116000	Yay.
116000	131000	Okay, uh, this one looks, it looks a little bit like a rabbit because it's got, like,
131000	139000	two triangles pointing out the right side and then it's got, like, a square for, like,
139000	143000	or, like, kind of a tilted diamond for, like, the...
143000	145000	Yeah, like a parallelogram?
145000	148000	Yeah, for the tail and then the legs are, like, separated.
149000	152000	Um, is it kind of long looking?
152000	158000	Uh, it's kind of long in, like, the vertical direction.
159000	161000	But not very long.
162000	166000	In the vertical direction. But it does have a parallelogram head?
166000	170000	Uh, yes, a little bit.
170000	171000	Oh.
171000	173000	Oh, no.
176000	178000	Oh, okay.
182000	188000	Um, this one's, like, it looks like a house and there's, like, a really long chimney
188000	193000	that's, like, a really elongated rectangle on the right side.
193000	211000	Um, this one looks a little bit like a little guy that's, like, has his legs spread apart
211000	215000	really, like, widely, but, like, doesn't have arms.
216000	220000	Can you say a little more? There's two guys that kind of look like that.
220000	223000	They appear to be almost mirrors of each other.
223000	229000	Uh, could you describe, like, what the two guys look like?
229000	231000	The two guys both have diamond heads.
231000	232000	Uh-huh.
232000	234000	Both have kind of triangles right below the diamond.
234000	235000	Yes.
235000	241000	And one is kind of leaning to the left and the other one, it looks a little more balanced.
241000	244000	He's got a foot kicking out to the left.
244000	249000	Uh, I think it's a second one with the foot pointing out to the left.
264000	272000	Uh, this one looks a little bit like a guy that's riding, like, a horse or, like, a dog or something.
272000	278000	Um, and this is the, I think there's two that look vaguely similar to that,
278000	284000	but this is the one where, like, his head is, like, pointing down and towards the left
284000	288000	and, like, the body is a triangle instead of a parallelogram.
292000	294000	Yay.
294000	305000	Um, so this was, like, the same as the rabbit, but you, like, picked it earlier, but it was wrong.
305000	315000	So it's, like, the one that's kind of, like, uh, the weird dog-shaped thing that's, like, yeah.
315000	320000	I guess it looks like that much like a rabbit.
320000	335000	Uh, this one, I don't know, it looks like a person with his right foot stretched out,
335000	342000	but it also looks vaguely like a water fountain if you look at it from a different, like, perspective.
342000	344000	I don't know if that's clear at all.
344000	345000	Diamond head?
345000	346000	Yes.
350000	351000	Cool.
357000	361000	Um, this one looks like a bit of a signpost or, like, a totem pole,
361000	368000	so it's, like, just a straight, like, thing, stick-like thing sticking out of the ground,
368000	371000	and it's got, like, little protrusions on each side.
371000	373000	I thought of it like barbed wire.
373000	374000	Oh.
374000	375000	Yeah?
375000	377000	Yeah, that's clever.
380000	394000	This one looks like a guy who's, like, in a half-squatting position with his, like, arms out.
394000	398000	There's a cop-a-muffin like that.
399000	409000	Um, this is the one where, uh, the legs are, like, pointed in, like, a chevron kind of shape.
414000	416000	Like, if you just look at the legs.
416000	418000	And the arms are, like, a triangle.
422000	423000	Nice.
428000	437000	Um, okay, this one's kind of weird.
437000	441000	When I first saw it, it looked kind of like a bird without a head,
441000	445000	but it's, like, got this, like, weird claw thing at the front,
445000	451000	and then the back is, like, a bit of, like, a triangle kind of shape.
451000	456000	Uh, I thought it's just the one that kind of looks like a crab going up to the other leg.
456000	458000	Yeah, a little bit.
458000	462000	Yeah, I didn't know how to describe it.
468000	478000	Um, this one looks like a guy who's, like, in a really weird pose who's, like, dragging his head.
478000	483000	He's in a really weird pose who's, like, dragging something along,
483000	486000	so, like, one of the legs is, like, really long,
486000	489000	and then, so on the left there's, like, a leg that's really long,
489000	492000	and the right side is, like, a triangle.
492000	510000	Uh, this one is, like, a bowl or, like, just, like, a claw of a crab without anything attached to it.
522000	529000	Okay, this is, like, the other guy doing the weird, like, pose where his legs are spread apart,
529000	533000	um, but then he, like, the opening is towards the right.
534000	536000	Oh, my god.
541000	543000	Yes.
551000	557000	Oh, this looks like kind of like a priest who's, like, holding out some sort of offering a little bit,
557000	560000	so it looks like he has, like, really long sleeves.
561000	563000	Um, okay.
563000	567000	And he's kind of straight up and down for his body and legs and stuff.
567000	569000	Yes.
579000	583000	Oh, this one looks like the house with the bomb tray on the left.
590000	600000	Uh, this one looks like the guy who's pretending to fly so he has, like, his arms out,
600000	603000	and it's, like, his legs aren't shown.
608000	614000	Um, there's one that's very simple that just looks a bit like a parallelogram,
614000	616000	where someone's flying to the top left.
616000	617000	Yes.
617000	619000	I almost think it looks like a little turtle or something.
619000	621000	Oh, interesting.
621000	623000	It does look like a turtle.
629000	634000	Um, this one's the one with the square and, like, a rectangle straight on the left,
634000	637000	and I think you called it, like, a swan earlier.
648000	654000	Uh, this one's, like, the other rabbit shape,
654000	660000	but the body is mainly a triangle with, like, another triangle attached to it.
660000	664000	Oh, yeah, like a rabbit sitting down facing right?
664000	665000	Yeah.
665000	682000	Uh, this one looks like some sort of animal or, like, a dog that's, like, jumping,
682000	687000	and his, like, tail looks kind of like a diamond on the right,
687000	693000	and then his head is, like, facing sort of down, but it's just, like, a very small triangle.
695000	699000	Uh, is the head at the top left corner?
701000	705000	Uh, I guess you could think of it that way,
705000	708000	and then, like, the tail might be on the top.
708000	711000	Uh, sorry, the... actually...
713000	716000	I don't know, could you say again what you... how you describe it?
716000	718000	Uh, yeah, sure.
718000	721000	It's like a dog with its, like, legs up,
721000	724000	but, like, depending on which side you're looking at it,
724000	727000	it's like a diamond on, like, the top right corner,
727000	730000	and a triangle on the bottom left corner.
741000	743000	I don't know what that...
743000	746000	Yeah, I really don't know. Maybe you should keep going.
746000	747000	Uh...
747000	751000	Is there another way to describe it without thinking a dog?
751000	753000	Let me think.
756000	758000	Uh...
763000	766000	I'm not sure what else it looks like.
766000	770000	But on the right side, there's, like, a diamond shape,
770000	775000	and then beneath it is kind of like a large triangle,
775000	778000	and then that's fused to, like, a parallelogram
778000	782000	with, like, triangles coming off of the bottom left side of it.
788000	789000	Uh...
789000	791000	Oh. Yeah.
791000	793000	Okay.
793000	795000	Yeah, that's a tricky one.
795000	797000	It is. I don't know how you would describe it.
797000	799000	I thought it was someone holding a martini glass.
799000	801000	Oh!
801000	802000	Hmm.
802000	805000	Um, this one looks like some sort of, like,
805000	808000	dinosaur or some sort of bird,
808000	811000	and the head is on the right side
811000	815000	with, like, wings on, like, the left side.
815000	819000	And then there's, like, two little triangles for the legs.
819000	822000	Two little triangles.
823000	826000	This... Oh, is it the one that just has, like,
826000	829000	one little triangle sticking out of the bottom left corner?
829000	831000	Yes.
835000	837000	Uh...
842000	846000	Uh, this one is just, like, a really simple shape,
846000	849000	but it's mainly, like, a parallelogram
849000	854000	with something sticking out of, like, the bottom on the left side.
858000	860000	I don't know about that side.
866000	868000	Uh...
868000	870000	This one looks...
870000	872000	Okay, this is really weird.
872000	875000	This looks like a guy who's, like,
875000	878000	kind of, like, bending over,
878000	881000	but there's, like, something coming out of his butt
881000	883000	of, like, the right side,
883000	886000	and his head is, like, on the top left corner.
886000	888000	Oh. Oh.
888000	891000	Oh, I thought it was a figure skater.
891000	893000	Oh!
893000	895000	I'm just saying.
898000	902000	Uh, this one looks kind of like the face of, like,
902000	904000	a cliff or something,
904000	907000	and then there's, like, a diamond at the top.
907000	909000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
909000	911000	Uh...
922000	925000	Uh, this looks like some animal
925000	928000	that's, like, in the middle of, like, a gallop or something,
928000	931000	so there's, like, a really long neck on the left side,
931000	934000	and then there's, like, a parallelogram tail
934000	936000	coming out of the right side.
939000	941000	Uh...
946000	951000	Uh, this one looks like some sort of, like, dog
951000	954000	or maybe, like, I don't...
954000	956000	rabbit or something
956000	959000	that's, like, with his face pointing on the left,
959000	961000	and then for the ears,
961000	963000	there's, like, a triangle on the right,
963000	966000	and then at the top there's, like, a diamond.
969000	972000	And it also kind of looks like a mouse.
978000	981000	Could you describe it again? I don't really see what you mean.
981000	984000	Uh, it looks kind of like a mouse
984000	988000	with, like, its head, like, facing the left side,
988000	992000	because there's, like, a triangle that's, like, a snout,
992000	997000	and then there's, like, a diamond for the left ear,
997000	1000000	and then for the right ear there's, like, a triangle for the right ear.
1006000	1009000	It also... Oh, okay.
1012000	1015000	I feel like they're getting harder.
1018000	1022000	Um, this also looks like a guy squatting a little bit,
1022000	1024000	but it looks like...
1024000	1027000	Actually, he kind of looks like he's sitting,
1027000	1029000	and then there's, like, a diamond for the head,
1029000	1032000	and then the rest of the body is just, like, one shape.
1045000	1050000	Uh, this one I really don't know how to describe it.
1050000	1054000	It looks a little bit like a person with, like,
1054000	1058000	a little triangle at the very top,
1058000	1063000	and then there's, like, something connected to, like, a diamond,
1063000	1068000	and it looks almost like he's, like, handing away that diamond or something.
1070000	1073000	And the diamond is, like, facing up the left.
1074000	1076000	This is not the Martini guy.
1077000	1078000	Uh, no.
1079000	1081000	Diamond's facing left.
1082000	1086000	But it's towards the bottom, and there's a triangle at the top.
1089000	1091000	Wait, sorry, diamond head.
1092000	1095000	Oh, no, the head is, like, a triangle.
1096000	1098000	Triangle head.
1103000	1105000	Sorry, can you repeat it?
1105000	1108000	Yeah, it looks a little bit like a guy who's, like,
1108000	1112000	facing the left with a triangle for the head,
1112000	1118000	and then, like, a diamond as, like, some sort of gift that he's, like, facing away,
1118000	1122000	or, like, giving away, and it's, like, facing the left.
1125000	1127000	Yeah, I guess.
1136000	1142000	Oh, this one looks like a tank or maybe, like, a boat with, like, a diamond sticking out of it.
1153000	1157000	Oh, this one also looks a bit like a water fountain,
1157000	1160000	and then there's a tri- oh, sorry, not a triangle,
1160000	1163000	a diamond sticking out the top.
1165000	1167000	Oh, whoops.
1176000	1181000	Uh, this looks like someone who's, like, bent on their knees,
1181000	1186000	and there's, like, two, like, diamonds,
1186000	1193000	and then the second diamond is connected to, like, to a triangle.
1195000	1201000	And then there's, like, something that's, like, angled outward toward the right.
1213000	1216000	Oh, this one, I don't really know when I first saw it.
1216000	1220000	It kind of looks like one of the heads from, like, Easter Island,
1220000	1225000	but, like, bent over to the left.
1230000	1232000	And then, yeah.
1232000	1234000	Easter Island?
1234000	1237000	Oh, maybe, I guess.
1237000	1239000	A little bit.
1241000	1244000	Oh, this guy looks like he's, like, backpacking,
1244000	1247000	and he's got, like, two triangles for the feet.
1247000	1250000	Oh, yeah, for me, this was a frog in a top hat.
1250000	1252000	Oh!
1252000	1255000	I don't know why I got frog fives to this guy.
1260000	1265000	Oh, this guy looks like he's, like, kind of resting in the corner,
1265000	1270000	and he's, like, sitting next to a wall or something.
1278000	1289000	Oh, this is, like, a parallelogram guy who's, like, riding a dog or a horse or something.
1300000	1303000	Oh, this one looks kind of like a flower.
1303000	1309000	That's, like, got three triangles kind of coming out the top,
1309000	1312000	and then, like, a stem to the right.
1328000	1330000	Nice, good job.
1330000	1332000	Yes, you too.
1333000	1335000	Hello?
1335000	1337000	Yay!
1337000	1339000	Ha, ha, ha!
1339000	1341000	Ha, ha!
1341000	1343000	Yep.
1343000	1345000	Yeah.
