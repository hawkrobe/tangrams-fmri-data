0	11920	Okay, so this one looks like someone who's imitating a swan.
11920	21920	It consists of a rectangle and then on its left, it's like, it's like if you were playing
21920	29200	like the game of shadows, that's how you would try to make a swan with your, with your wrist
29200	31200	being sort of flappy.
31200	37200	Okay, does it look like on the right side, there's like a small triangle?
37200	45200	Yeah, so it's a rectangle and then a longer rectangle on its left side and then a small
45200	47200	triangle.
47200	57200	Okay, could it also look like somebody doing an arabesque?
57200	61200	Um, not really.
61200	63200	Okay, I think I might be on the wrong one.
63200	67200	Yeah, yeah, it's not like someone making an arabesque.
67200	69200	It's a much easier one, it's a planer.
69200	71200	Oh, okay.
71200	73200	So, it is only a rectangle.
73200	75200	It's only like four shapes.
75200	77200	Yes, yes.
77200	79200	Okay, I think I got it.
79200	81200	No.
81200	83200	Okay, we'll get it.
83200	85200	Okay, that's okay.
85200	89200	Yep.
89200	91200	Okay, so this one is pretty complex.
91200	101200	Um, it looks like there is a child and two adults, but basically, I don't know if I'm
101200	109200	too conceptual, but anyways, imagine that there is a smaller figure and it's a triangle
109200	119200	and a square and then there is a bigger figure as if overlooking it and it has two smaller
119200	127200	triangles, like equilateral triangles that are tilted different ways.
127200	133200	Okay, I see a couple of that, I think that description.
133200	137200	You can ask clarifying questions if you're not sure.
137200	141200	So, a bunch of these shapes have a diamond at the top.
141200	145200	Does it have a diamond at the top?
145200	153200	It's only one of the figures within the picture has a diamond at the top.
153200	159200	It's like as if there's multiple heads rather than one.
159200	169200	Okay, is there a small triangle in the bottom right quarter?
169200	171200	No.
171200	173200	Okay.
173200	183200	Um, it's, I don't know how else to explain it.
183200	193200	Okay, is there, is the left side more complex and have more shapes than the right side?
193200	195200	No, no.
195200	197200	Okay.
197200	199200	I think vice versa.
199200	201200	Oh, okay.
201200	203200	The right side.
203200	205200	Yeah.
205200	207200	The right side is a little more complex.
207200	209200	Okay.
209200	227200	Left side only has a triangle and like a diamond on top as if, but it's a small figure.
227200	233200	Okay, I think I might see one that's, um, I don't think it's that one.
233200	235200	Oh.
235200	237200	I accidentally clicked the wrong button.
237200	239200	Okay.
239200	245200	It's all right.
245200	251200	Okay, this one looks like someone who is reading a book.
251200	255200	And there's a couple of them who are looking like they're reading a book.
255200	263200	But this one looks like, like it's sitting on, like they're kneeled.
263200	265200	And is there a triangle at the top?
265200	267200	Yes.
267200	269200	And, um.
269200	271200	And they're turned to the left.
271200	273200	Yes.
273200	275200	Yeah.
275200	277200	I think this one, yeah.
277200	279200	Perfect.
279200	287200	Yay.
287200	289200	Okay.
289200	293200	This one is also reading, but it's turned to the right.
293200	297200	And it's reading off a triangle.
297200	299200	And it's had as a diamond.
299200	305200	And on the left side, there's a triangle in the bottom left corner.
305200	307200	Yes.
307200	309200	And then there's like a triangle that signifies a hood.
309200	311200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
311200	313200	Okay, nice.
313200	321200	Last one.
321200	331200	Okay, this looks like someone who is riding a horse.
331200	335200	Okay, I think I can see a couple that might be like that.
335200	343200	Yeah, so this one has like a small little triangle at the left corner.
343200	349200	And it's like a, it's like an ear of a horse.
349200	357200	And the person, the person itself is like, like a little parallelogram and a square.
357200	359200	On top?
359200	363200	On the right side, is there a little triangle that looks like a horse tail?
363200	365200	Yes.
365200	375200	Yay.
375200	379200	Okay, this one looks like just a horse.
379200	385200	Or, yeah, it looks like a horse, but...
385200	389200	God, um...
389200	391200	Yeah.
391200	393200	And it's turned to the left?
393200	395200	Yeah, it's turned to the left.
395200	399200	Okay, and there's two really similar ones that look like that.
399200	403200	Is there a tail on the right side, like something that looks like a tail?
403200	405200	Yes, yes.
405200	407200	And it's going upwards?
407200	413200	Uh, yes, the tail is going upwards.
413200	415200	But it doesn't, yep, yep, you're right.
415200	423200	Okay.
423200	427200	Okay, this one looks like a person in a boat.
427200	429200	It doesn't really have a direction.
429200	433200	And the person's head is a diamond.
433200	435200	Is it symmetrical, like a symmetrical thing?
435200	437200	Yes, it is symmetrical.
437200	441200	Okay, and then diamond, triangle, and then boat.
441200	453200	Nice.
453200	455200	Oh.
455200	465200	This one looks somewhat theatrical, as if the person is going to the right and they have a long, like, dress, tail sort of thing.
465200	471200	And they're, like, one of their legs is, like, going out of the skirt.
471200	475200	On the top left, is there a square?
475200	479200	Yes, it has, like, a diamond shape, yep.
479200	481200	Nice.
481200	485200	I thought that one looked like somebody running out on their wedding.
485200	487200	Exactly.
487200	499200	Um, okay, this one looks like a person with, like, um, you know how Maddie has, like, a collar with, like, a white collar?
499200	501200	Yeah.
501200	507200	So this looks like a person who's, like, standing, uh, their feet is, like, two small triangles.
507200	509200	Does it look like they're wearing a top hat?
509200	511200	Yeah, they do.
511200	513200	It looks like a dolphin wearing a top hat.
513200	515200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
515200	521200	Nice.
521200	523200	That one does look like Maddie.
523200	529200	Okay, this one looks like, uh, an animal.
529200	551200	So, it's like, um, so it's turned left, and it has a parallelogram as its head, rather than a diamond.
551200	553200	So there's not a diamond on top?
553200	555200	Yeah, there's no diamond on top.
555200	558200	Okay, so it kind of looks like a dog, like, without a tail.
558200	559200	Yes, yes.
559200	567200	And turned left, so it, from top to bottom, it's, like, parallelogram, square, rectangle, and then two legs?
567200	573200	Um, just a second, I'm thinking whether anything else can look like it.
573200	582200	Um, yeah, it looks like it's, like, sitting on its bottom feet, but its front feet are, like, um, are, like, extended.
582200	584200	Yeah, the front legs are longer.
584200	596200	Okay, we got it.
596200	601200	Okay, this one also looks like someone who is on a, on a horse or something.
601200	612200	They're moving to the left, and it looks like a triangle and a diamond of the person who's, I think we already did that one, but maybe it's a different one.
612200	614200	And the tail is going up on the right side?
614200	620200	Yeah, the tail is going up on the right side, and it's a little triangle of a tail.
620200	631200	Yep, nice.
631200	641200	Okay, this one is symmetrical, and it consists of, like, two, two diamonds that are, like, overlaid in each other.
641200	642200	And then there's a square on top?
642200	645200	Yeah, and then there's a square on top, yep.
645200	654200	Nice.
654200	659200	Okay, this one is also symmetrical, and it kind of looks like a crab.
659200	668200	So, it's, it's, like, symmetrical, it's, like, um, god, I forgot the shape.
668200	671200	It's, like, two parallelograms, the small parallelograms.
671200	673200	On the top, and then there's, like, a bigger shape on the bottom?
673200	685200	Yeah, yeah. Yep, trapezoid. Yep.
685200	696200	Okay, this one looks like, like a person with wings, and they're looking to the right, but their feet are looking to the left.
696200	706200	It's, like, there's a diamond, and it looks like their head is a little tilted.
706200	708200	Okay, I'm a little lost.
708200	717200	Okay, yeah, I will. So, it's one that looks like a person, and it has a little diamond, but it's not straight up.
717200	729200	It's, like, a little tilted, and then there is a little, like, a square trapezoid that looks like wings.
739200	743200	And it looks like the person is, like, standing, right? Yes, yes.
743200	750200	And is the diamond that's, like, kind of tilted? Like, I can't really tell if it's, like, a diamond or a square. Is that on the right side?
750200	766200	Yes, yes. And then it looks like there's, like, a foot sticking out on the left side? Yep, yep, yep.
766200	775200	Okay, this one looks like a house with a big tree on the left. The tree is, like... That's easy, yeah.
775200	801200	Okay, this one looks like someone with their, like, hands spread, and with a little diamond on top.
801200	805200	It looks like someone's trying to fly. Yes, yes.
815200	829200	Okay, this one looks like a cactus. It's pretty, like... It's vertical, and it has, like, two things going out each side.
829200	840200	Yeah, so there's, like, a big, tall column, and then on both sides there's a trapezoid? Yep.
840200	861200	Okay, this one looks like a... Do you know cardinals from, like, the Pope's cardinals? No.
861200	877200	Okay, sorry, that wasn't... But basically, it looks like someone with a big hat, because it's had as, like, a diamond, and it looks like they're next to a stand, and they're reading from it.
878200	883200	Um, is there... So, there's a diamond at the very top, right? Yes, yes.
883200	893200	And then, beneath the diamond, on the right side, is it a straight line, but then on the left side, it's, like, a wiggly line?
893200	902200	Yeah, on the left side, it looks like a little... It looks like a little stand, you know?
902200	907200	It looks like someone is holding a top hat upside out. Yes, yes.
915200	918200	Now I need to show you how the cardinals look. Okay.
919200	939200	Um, okay, this one looks like, um, like someone is sitting, and they're turned to the right, and they have a hat, and they hold their diamond hand as usual, but then out of it, there's two triangles, as if, like, a bow.
939200	945200	It looks like a bunny. Yeah, it does. Like a rabbit sitting in your spacing. Yeah, Judy Hopps.
948200	971200	Okay, this one is another figure that looks like, um, like a person, and it has a diamond on top, and it looks like it has... is wearing, like...
971200	985200	Okay, um, so it's, like, a person who is kneeled, but they sit up top, and then they're... I don't know if that's making any sense.
985200	989200	Okay, I see, like, a couple that I think it might be. Okay.
989200	993200	So, do you want to ask clarifying questions?
994200	1000200	So, are there, like, two main chains?
1002200	1010200	Yeah, kind of, kind of. Yeah, there is, like, the body that is turned to the right, you know?
1010200	1015200	Okay, so there's... I see, like, two really similar ones, so...
1016200	1020200	So, one has a triangle, and it's not the right one.
1021200	1039200	Okay, um, so I was asking about this one before, but is it... is it this one with a diamond on the top, and then on the left side, it's a straight line, and on the right side, it's, like, the line is, like, comes in a little bit?
1042200	1043200	Or is that the wrong one?
1043200	1056200	I'm just thinking, just a second. So, no, no, no, no, no, it's a little different. Um, so, it's, like, it has... it has a top, um...
1058200	1069200	Basically, on the top, there is a diamond, and then there is a shape, and it goes out, actually, on the right. It looks like it's someone kneeling.
1069200	1072200	Okay, okay, and...
1075200	1077200	Okay, um...
1079200	1084200	Yeah, so it's almost symmetrical, except for the part in the bottom right corner.
1084200	1085200	Yes, yes.
1087200	1088200	That was a tricky one.
1089200	1090200	Yeah.
1091200	1093200	It's not really looking like anything.
1093200	1094200	Yeah.
1094200	1118200	Okay, this one is kind of a complex shape. In the bottom, it's, like, a trapezoid, and on the top, there is also a diamond. Looks like a person. It looks like on the left, there is a stand, and then they have, like, a triangle sticking out from, like...
1118200	1119200	I think I got it.
1119200	1120200	Yeah.
1120200	1124200	It looks like there's two legs, and their left leg, like, their foot is turning in.
1124200	1125200	Yeah.
1125200	1126200	Okay.
1126200	1127200	Oh, no.
1129200	1130200	Oh, no.
1131200	1132200	Uh, yeah.
1132200	1133200	Okay, it's alright.
1133200	1134200	We got this.
1134200	1135200	We got this, yeah.
1136200	1160200	Okay, this one also looks like the kneel person. Um, it looks like they're turned to the right, and they are, like, reading from a triangle, and there is a diamond as their head shape, and, um, what else can I tell you about it?
1161200	1165200	Okay, I see two with that description, and they're, like, really similar again.
1165200	1166200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1166200	1171200	So, on the left side, does it look like there's a tail, like, sticking out?
1171200	1172200	Yes, yes.
1172200	1173200	Okay.
1173200	1187200	So, just to clarify, from top to bottom, it's the diamond head, and then, like, another little diamond, but then on the right side, it's, like, a little triangle, and then, okay.
1187200	1188200	Yeah.
1189200	1190200	It's worked.
1190200	1210200	Okay, so this one is, um, is the one that you probably thought in the previous one.
1210200	1219200	It's also kneeled, but it has, like, the knees are sticking out, and on the left, there is, like, a little dent, you know?
1219200	1220200	Yeah.
1220200	1221200	Yeah.
1221200	1222200	So, yeah.
1222200	1224200	It doesn't have, like, yeah, got it.
1233200	1248200	Okay, this one looks like a seahorse, and it's, like, turned to the left, and it's, like, pretty long from, like, diagonally.
1248200	1253200	And then, on the bottom right, there's, like, a little weird shape at the bottom.
1253200	1254200	Yes.
1254200	1255200	Yeah.
1256200	1258200	Seahorse was a, that was a good indicator.
1258200	1276200	Okay, this one looks like a person.
1276200	1277200	Okay.
1277200	1278200	Okay.
1278200	1297200	There's, like, two figures, if I'm, if I would say so, and one is a, has a square, and one has a triangle as a head, and then the one with a square also has, like, a triangle.
1297200	1303200	It's, like, an interesting shape triangle.
1303200	1308200	And I don't know how to else to describe it.
1308200	1310200	Is there a diamond at the very top?
1310200	1311200	Yes.
1311200	1315200	And then, to the right of the diamond, is there a triangle?
1315200	1318200	Yeah, to the right of the diamond, there is a triangle.
1318200	1320200	And also, kind of to the left?
1320200	1326200	And then, to the left, yeah, kind of to the left, but to the left, it looks like there is another figure.
1326200	1339200	Yeah, so I feel like it might kind of look like somebody wearing, like, a pointed hood, kneeled down, looking to the right with a megaphone.
1339200	1341200	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1341200	1342200	Not that one?
1342200	1343200	It's not that one, not that one.
1343200	1344200	Okay.
1344200	1348200	It's a different one, because it has, like, two figures.
1348200	1354200	So, it looks like they're looking at each other, and one is much smaller than the other.
1354200	1369200	The one where the head is triangle is much smaller than one where the head is the square, like, not a square, a diamond.
1369200	1376200	Does it look like somebody wearing wings doing an arabesque with their leg out to the back?
1376200	1377200	No.
1377200	1381200	Okay, not that one.
1381200	1384200	What could this one be? Could you, like, describe it again?
1384200	1387200	Yeah, so it looks like there's two figures.
1387200	1396200	One is much smaller, and it has an equilateral triangle that is turned, like, the base up.
1396200	1408200	And to the right, there is a, it's like a diamond shape at the top, but then it's, like, a triangle down.
1408200	1417200	Could it look like a horse with its front legs up, like, if a horse was turned to the right with its front leg up?
1417200	1422200	It's turned to the right, so...
1422200	1429200	Like, picture the top diamond as the horse's head, and then that little triangle on the left as the tail?
1429200	1431200	Okay, okay.
1431200	1442200	Also, I think the thing with the arm is happening to me because it's kind of giving off my right arm.
1442200	1449200	This one is a strange shape. It looks like a surveillance camera.
1449200	1452200	Oh, okay, turned to the right.
1452200	1454200	I don't know.
1454200	1459200	Yeah.
1459200	1469200	Yeah, my arm kind of gets numb. It's all right, though.
1469200	1476200	Okay, so this one looks like a thing that is...
1476200	1478200	Oh, God.
1478200	1483200	I don't know. So, it's a strange shape, and it looks like it's turned to the left.
1483200	1489200	There is a big triangle at the bottom, and then there is...
1489200	1491200	Eh, God.
1491200	1497200	Okay, it looks like the old scales that are pretty...
1497200	1499200	Oh, like a law scale?
1499200	1500200	Yeah, like a law scale.
1500200	1501200	And it's, like, tilted?
1501200	1503200	Yeah, it's tilted, yeah.
1514200	1522200	This one looks like a person who's walking and reading at the same time.
1522200	1524200	And the book is on the left side?
1524200	1537200	Yes.
1537200	1551200	Okay, this one is the one that you were describing, where there is a diamond at the top, and then the left is a straight line, and the right is like a squiggly line.
1551200	1566200	Okay.
1566200	1570200	This one looks like a house with a big chimney. A huge chimney on the left.
1570200	1571200	On the right side?
1571200	1585200	Yeah, okay.
1585200	1598200	This one looks like a flower, but more like a Venus flytrap. It has, like, a little stem at the right, and then it's, like, multiple triangles on the top.
1598200	1612200	Oh, okay. I see it.
1612200	1617200	Okay, this one looks kind of funny.
1617200	1638200	It has, okay, it has a diamond on the top, and then it looks like it's sliding downhill with its feet, which is a little triangle on the bottom right, and its hands, like, sort of up as another trapezoid triangle thing.
1638200	1651200	And it has, like, two tails. One is a trapezoid, like a right trapezoid, and one is a triangle.
1651200	1654200	It looks like it's, like, sliding downhill.
1654200	1655200	Sliding downhill?
1655200	1662200	Yeah.
1662200	1672200	It looks like a person in, like, a robe, and that has, like, one tail and another tail, and one tail is a triangle on the bottom.
1672200	1676200	So, on the very bottom right, is there a triangle?
1676200	1678200	Yes, yes, it's like the feet.
1678200	1683200	Okay, and then on the left side, there's, like, a weird, like, parallelogram shape sticking out?
1683200	1695200	Yes, yes, okay.
1695200	1700200	Okay, this one looks like a person reading a book. They're turned to the left.
1700200	1724200	And they have a diamond shape, and it's like their knees are, like, yeah, it's like the book is on their knees, and there's, like, a little triangle on the bottom left that, like, is their feet.
1724200	1728200	Are there two triangles at the top that kind of look like little bunny ears?
1728200	1729200	No.
1729200	1735200	Okay, not that one.
1735200	1737200	Could you describe it again?
1737200	1741200	Yeah, so it looks like a person who's sitting with their, like, knees up.
1741200	1745200	Oh, does it look like they're sitting in a beanbag chair?
1745200	1749200	Um, kind of, yeah.
1749200	1751200	Yeah.
1751200	1758200	Now I see it.
1758200	1766200	Okay, this one looks like they're doing a cha-cha slide, and they're sliding to the left.
1766200	1786200	But, like, it is, like, a kind of a complex thing, and there's, like, a diamond at the top, and then there is, like, a triangle shape, and then there's, like, I think sticking out to the right, and then a squiggly line on the left.
1786200	1788200	Oh.
1788200	1794200	So this isn't the one, I think we might have done this one before, where it looks like their left foot is turned in?
1794200	1804200	Well, yeah, so that one is the one that you picked, but it wasn't the right one, but it's the right one this time.
1804200	1806200	They're doing a cha-cha slide, that's for sure.
1806200	1810200	Yeah, slide to the left.
1810200	1813200	Okay, this one looks like a bird.
1813200	1815200	It's turned to the right.
1815200	1818200	Oh, like a little swan, and then there's a little triangle on the left side.
1818200	1819200	Yes, yes.
1819200	1830200	Perfect.
1830200	1836200	Okay, this one is a person doing an arabesque.
1836200	1838200	It was fast.
1838200	1840200	Look at us.
1840200	1841200	Two dancers.
1848200	1850200	Okay.
