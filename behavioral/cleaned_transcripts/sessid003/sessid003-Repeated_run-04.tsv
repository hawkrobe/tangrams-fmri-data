10000	13000	Oh, he's not so simple, maybe.	1
13000	19000	He's not. He's probably got like a 401k. He's gonna retire soon.	1

54000	56000	Yeah, no, that's so true.
56000	60000	It's the beautiful fountain.
60000	62000	Not the drinking fountain.
62000	75000	Not the drinking one. The garden one.

82000	84000	Oh, the guy with the bowl.
84000	87000	Yeah.
87000	90000	I think he's my favorite.
90000	94000	Yeah, it could be a bowl. It could be the top hat man, who took off his hat.
94000	98000	True, and now he's holding it for him.
98000	107000	It's the horse with the flat butt.
107000	110000	Poor horse, that's what he's known by.
110000	112000	Let's call him Daryl.
112000	113000	Daryl?
113000	114000	Daryl.
114000	117000	Alright.
117000	121000	Um, it's karate dancing guy with the black belt.
121000	125000	I like this guy.
125000	128000	He's kind of like the angry running guy, but a little more flamboyant.
128000	138000	Yes!
138000	141000	It's the shitting goose.
141000	142000	I see.
142000	144000	This poor goose.
144000	146000	Maybe he's having a good time, though.
146000	148000	I mean, that's all they do.
148000	149000	True.
149000	150000	Like, they just poop everywhere.
150000	158000	He's in his, like, home territory with that.
158000	172000	It's the drinking fountain.
172000	190000	It's the house with the tree.
190000	200000	It's the praying guy, but like, he's squatting, he's not on his knees, his hands are out to the right.
201000	204000	He's doing like a leg, what's it called? A wall sit.
204000	207000	Yeah, a wall sit. Perfect.
207000	208000	I hate those.
208000	217000	Me too.
217000	233000	It's the TV stand.
233000	235000	It's happy chihuahua guy.
235000	238000	Yay.
238000	241000	Doesn't that look like he's, like, flying, like, holding on to the front?
241000	253000	I can see that.
253000	270000	It's the angry policeman.
270000	278000	Oh, it's not the guy doing the wall sit, it's the other one with his hands out, like, on their knees.
278000	279000	Yeah.
280000	288000	Yeah.
288000	307000	The guy that looks like the bear with the smelly towel.
308000	315000	It's not Daryl the horse, it's the other horse with the tail.
315000	317000	What's his name?
317000	320000	Oh, you get to pick that one.
320000	324000	How about Johnny?
324000	330000	Okay.
330000	333000	Um, it's the sad guy on the chihuahua.
333000	337000	Oh.
337000	338000	Sad bears.
338000	345000	Yeah.
