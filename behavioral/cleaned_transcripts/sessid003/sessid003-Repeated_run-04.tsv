94000	98000	True, and now he's holding it for him.	5
98000	107000	It's the horse with the flat butt.	6

125000	128000	He's kind of like the angry running guy, but a little more flamboyant.	7
128000	138000	Yes!	7
138000	141000	It's the shitting goose.	8
141000	142000	I see.	8
142000	144000	This poor goose.	8
144000	146000	Maybe he's having a good time, though.	8
146000	148000	I mean, that's all they do.	8
148000	149000	True.	8
149000	150000	Like, they just poop everywhere.	8
150000	158000	He's in his, like, home territory with that.	8
158000	172000	It's the drinking fountain.	9
172000	190000	It's the house with the tree.	10
190000	200000	It's the praying guy, but like, he's squatting, he's not on his knees, his hands are out to the right.	11
201000	204000	He's doing like a leg, what's it called? A wall sit.	11
204000	207000	Yeah, a wall sit. Perfect.	11
207000	208000	I hate those.	11

253000	270000	It's the angry policeman.	14
270000	278000	Oh, it's not the guy doing the wall sit, it's the other one with his hands out, like, on their knees.	15
278000	279000	Yeah.	15
288000	307000	The guy that looks like the bear with the smelly towel.	16
308000	315000	It's not Daryl the horse, it's the other horse with the tail.	17
315000	317000	What's his name?	17
317000	320000	Oh, you get to pick that one.	17
