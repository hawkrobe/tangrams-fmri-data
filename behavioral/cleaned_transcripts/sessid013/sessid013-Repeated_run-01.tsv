295120	308120	more than like a, more than like a body, um, the like, it's like most of a rectangle, and
308120	314120	like there's right angles, like most of a square on the left sides, but on the right
314120	320120	side there's like a sort of jagged line instead of like more right angles.
325120	329120	Okay, this might be wrong though.
329120	331120	Oh, okay.
341120	347120	Um, it sort of looks like he's sitting on like a toilet or he's a throne or something.
348120	351120	Oh, that's a good description.

370120	377120	um, like he comes from like the top left corner down to the bottom right corner of his square,
377160	386160	um, and he's just sort of like, he's got like a little triangle head and little triangle
386160	389160	feet, yeah.

468200	473200	then two little feet that are triangles.
480200	490200	Um, it kind of looks like a boat or like a little like hat you make out of newspaper
490200	493200	in elementary school with a diamond on top of it.
493240	512240	Um, he's sort of standing on one leg with his back leg like kicked out sort of, almost
512240	515240	like he's doing an arabesque in ballet.
