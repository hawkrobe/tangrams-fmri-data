28000	43000	It's a very long, almost a rectangle, and on the left there's a trapezoid and on the

45000	46000	Okay.
TRIAL2	61000	Uh, okay.
64000	66000	So...
70000	73000	I wonder if I can just say...
73000	76000	Oh, maybe it's randomized for you.
76000	78000	Uh, it's...
79000	88000	So on the top of this figure there's two little triangles sticking out, almost like rabbit
88000	89000	ears.
89000	90000	Two triangles?
90000	98000	Yeah, it's sticking out like rabbit ears, and it's holding like a square.
98000	101000	Does it kind of look like it's reading a book?
101000	103000	Kind of, yeah.
105000	106000	What?
106000	107000	Yes.
109000	112000	I think I have it.
125000	133000	Okay, uh, it looks like a horse with a tail, so there's two shapes that kind of look like
133000	134000	animals.
134000	136000	Wait, can you talk louder?
136000	137000	What?
139000	140000	Sorry.
140000	147000	There are two shapes that look like animals on the screen, probably.
147000	151000	Maybe pick the one that looks like it has a tail.
151000	154000	It kind of looks like a horse.
154000	157000	The legs are triangular.
157000	158000	What?
159000	160000	I'm really trying.
160000	163000	Sorry, that was an accident.
168000	178000	It looks like an upside-down Christmas tree.
178000	181000	Like what?
181000	185000	It looks like an upside-down Christmas tree.
185000	187000	A house with a chimney?
187000	188000	No.
188000	190000	Christmas tree.
193000	196000	Uh, it looks like an upside-down tree.
199000	201000	Like what?
204000	208000	It looks like a tree that is upside-down.

210000	211000	Yes.
211000	212000	Okay.
212000	231000	Okay, but we just figure out which one that is.
231000	232000	Okay.
234000	237000	It looks like an animal.
237000	240000	Um, it has no tail.
240000	242000	An animal that has no tail.
242000	243000	Okay.
243000	244000	Sorry.
244000	245000	Um.
253000	254000	Is that?
254000	256000	I can hear better, but that was a mistake.
256000	257000	What?
258000	260000	It looks like a flower.
260000	261000	Uh-huh.

265000	266000	Okay.
270000	288000	Okay, so this looks like a person on the bottom of the shade.
288000	293000	There are two small triangles next to each other.
293000	296000	A what with a triangle?
296000	304000	There are two small triangles at the bottom as its feet.
304000	312000	Um, it has a square head.
312000	314000	It's just a normal square.
314000	316000	It's not tilted or anything.
316000	317000	Not a diamond.
317000	319000	It's just a square.
319000	320000	Okay.
320000	321000	Wow.
321000	325000	Is it like a guy with a long nose wearing a top hat?
325000	328000	It could be that, yes.
341000	343000	Okay, this one's a bit hard.
343000	344000	Um.
344000	360000	So this shape is, if you imagine it to be humanoid, it's sort of slouched down on the
360000	361000	ground.
361000	362000	Uh-huh.
362000	371000	Um, there's a square as a head that's slightly tilted, not quite a diamond.
371000	382000	Um, there are two small triangles sticking out to the right side of the shade.
382000	384000	Uh-huh.
384000	391000	Um, yeah, I'm not sure how to describe it better.
391000	392000	What?
392000	395000	I'm not sure how to describe it better.
396000	399000	Can you just say that one more time?
399000	407000	I'm just going to say that, okay, on the right, there's two small triangles.
407000	409000	It has a head.
409000	413000	Uh, it has a square forehead, slightly tilted.
413000	422000	Um, it's not the one that looks like, it's not the one that looks like it's riding an
422000	423000	animal.
423000	428000	Um, this shape is kind of like slouched down on the ground.
433000	435000	Oh, I see, okay.
435000	454000	It's one of the shapes that looks like it's holding a square book.
454000	456000	Holding the square book?
456000	457000	Yeah.
457000	458000	Okay.
465000	492000	Um, this figure looks like it's kneeling and it's reaching its hands out.
492000	503000	Um, but there's also a triangle that kind of sticks out to the left for its feet.
503000	505000	Um, so-
505000	511000	Wait, so it has its hands out or its feet up or down?
511000	515000	The feet is like kind of upwards.
515000	517000	Okay.
518000	539000	Um, it kind of looks like it's holding a glass of wine and the head is a diamond.
539000	541000	It's falling what?
541000	563000	The head is a diamond and it's holding a glass of wine.
563000	572000	This shape looks like a person with a square head that's tilted downwards and it has like
572000	574000	bunny ears.
574000	576000	What?
576000	578000	This shape has bunny ears.
578000	586000	Um, there are two triangles sticking out of a tilted square and it looks like a rabbit.
594000	598000	Can you describe it one more time?
598000	600000	It looks like a rabbit.
600000	602000	Like a rabbit?
602000	603000	Yeah.

622000	624000	It's reaching out.
624000	626000	It's not quite kneeling.
626000	636000	It's like, it's almost going to kneel.
636000	638000	Not quite what?
638000	639000	Kneeling.
639000	644000	So it's not kneeling on the ground, but it's like, it's almost as if this shape-
644000	645000	Okay.
645000	647000	There we go.
647000	673000	Um, honestly the shape looks like it's got a- it's only two shapes.
673000	683000	So on the top, there's a diamond and as the body, it's a fractured rectangle.
683000	685000	Is what?
685000	688000	It's a fractured rectangle for the body.
689000	708000	Um, oh.

756000	758000	The body is what?
758000	759000	It's a rectangle.
759000	764000	Uh, so it could also look like a Loch Ness monster.
764000	768000	Uh, sort of minimalist.
768000	769000	Is it holding anything?
769000	770000	No.
770000	779000	It's just a long neck and then the body is just a rectangle.
779000	782000	So it's an animal.
782000	783000	It's like an animal?
783000	792000	Yeah, with a long neck and a rectangle for the body.

822000	825000	Uh huh.
825000	837000	Yeah, that's very similar.
837000	842000	Alright, so this looks like a kid that's riding an animal.
842000	855000	Um, the kid has a slanted square as the head.
855000	857000	A kid that's riding an animal?

980000	998000	Okay.
998000	999000	Is its right leg up in the air?
999000	1023000	No, it's sort of pointed to the ground.
1023000	1026000	It looks like two shapes combined.
1026000	1037000	The left is an arrow pointing up and the right is like a little house and it's just merged.
1037000	1055000	Okay.
1055000	1060000	Um, I think this is one of the shapes that we accidentally crossed before.
1060000	1075000	It kind of looks like a seahorse.
1075000	1077000	Wait, so we've had it before?
1077000	1079000	I think you've misclicked it.
1079000	1083000	I said it was like a horse and it was like another animal.
1083000	1087000	Um, but it kind of looks like a seahorse.

1109000	1114000	Um, does it have a head?
1114000	1122000	I guess technically it's like a small triangle and it's kind of to the left of the figure.
1122000	1128000	Okay.
1129000	1143000	Oh.
1143000	1150000	Uh, this straight up looks like an angel on the ground.

1270000	1272000	C.
1272000	1274000	Um.
1274000	1277000	Capital or lowercase?
1277000	1282000	I guess capital C. It's very tilted.
1282000	1291000	Um, and there's like a triangle that's connected to the back of the C.
1291000	1294000	So there's a triangle?
1294000	1296000	Yeah, kind of.
1296000	1298000	And it looks like a capital E?
1298000	1300000	C.
