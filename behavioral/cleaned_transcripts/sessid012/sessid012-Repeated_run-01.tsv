520	2080	So,
2080	3080	yeah.
3080	4080	Yeah.
4080	5080	President,
5080	6080	yeah.
6080	7080	Okay.
7080	10080	Yeah.
10080	15440	Um,
15440	26440	Okay.
45440	60440	Okay.
60440	65440	Okay, so this is the one that looks like a person at graduation.
65440	69440	Not the one that looks like a toilet.
69440	72440	Okay.
72440	75440	Is the square that's rotated.
75440	87440	It looks as though the person is standing behind a podium. So that portion that's pointing to the left hand side. So is it like his hands are out to the left. Yeah.
87440	98440	And the little trap. Yeah, there we go.
98440	106440	Okay, so this is the person that is walking to the right. It's kind of giving Minecraft zombie thing.
106440	109440	Both arms are pointing right.
109440	126440	You can even make an argument that it has a little backpack the bottom feet are triangles but like small ones.
126440	130440	Okay, so this is our break dancing person.
130440	144440	Again with that one right leg that's like stretched out versus the left one that's been in words. So, the left foot is like a trapezoid connected to.
144440	152440	I guess you could call it a parallelogram. I don't know what shape that is. But then on the right side you have that longer parallelogram.
152440	168440	Is it like the break dancing one. Yeah. Okay.
168440	174440	Okay, so this is our one with the really really wide face again with the head.
174440	189440	You have a thin trapezoid on the bottom. Both points are facing the right hand side versus the left hand side is just the straight edge of that really like wide shape.
189440	193440	Wait, so the head is flat.
193440	196440	It's like the same square head as all of them.
196440	213440	It's just this is the one with the widest body.
213440	217440	Okay, so this is our ghost.
217440	225440	Looking off in the distance graduate, where you have the square attached to.
225440	229440	I don't even know how to break that shape up.
229440	232440	Oh, a pentagon.
232440	242440	And then another weird polygon that's kind of drifting off to the right.
242440	249440	There are no outside edges that you could use for arms for this.
249440	252440	No arms.
252440	256440	Is it like a person or no.
256440	269440	You can make an argument that it's a person, I think it looks like a graduate sitting down facing something, but like, if that makes any sense.
269440	272440	Describe this is the.
272440	275440	Does it have like a head.
275440	278440	Yes. Yes.
278440	289440	There we go.
289440	312440	This is the one that I think looks like a person doing yoga.
312440	317440	We have the head, the two triangle arms, the one leg.
317440	333440	That's also a triangle that's kicked backwards.
333440	356440	This is the one with the rectangle base.
356440	373440	And then the rectangle on the left hand side that's really thin.
373440	377440	Okay, so I think this looks like a crab.
377440	392440	And it's ultimately just three shapes, two parallelograms, one on the left hand side, one on the right hand side, connected to a trapezoid where the shortest side or like the short horizontal side is on the bottom.
392440	407440	The two parallelograms are attached to the long part.
407440	429440	This is the camel without any arms.
429440	434440	So I'm going to start by describing this from the top down.
434440	447440	It starts with a head, like the squares that we've been talking about, and immediately connected to it is a triangle, where it's hypotenuse isn't connected to anything.
447440	454440	It's that little right angle that's connected to the head.
454440	460440	On the left hand side, there's a trapezoid connected also to the head.
460440	467440	So you have the square, and then connected at one point, which you could argue is the net.
467440	478440	You have a trapezoid pointing to the left hand side, and a triangle also connected at that same point, pointing to the right hand side.
478440	488440	I think it kind of looks like a person stretching their arms out while they're kneeled, but that's getting ahead of myself.
488440	499440	There it is.
499440	514440	This is the toilet.
514440	536440	Oh, the submarine.
536440	540440	This is the person walking to the left.
540440	546440	They have one foot stretched outwards to indicate that they're moving.
546440	567440	They only have one arm, which is a trapezoid that's pointing to the left hand side.
567440	571440	I don't even know how to describe this.
571440	575440	Okay, we're starting from the top until I can figure out an image.
575440	578440	Again, this is a square.
578440	584440	This is one of the ones that are more ambiguous in what it could be viewed as.
584440	608440	And then it's connected to a weird shape that if you break it down, it's like a trapezoid connected to a right triangle.
608440	626440	This is the person on an aircraft that kind of looks like a box.
626440	639440	The bunny person who's reading a book.
639440	644440	It just has two triangles for years.
644440	647440	That's the most important part.
674440	686440	I think we won.
686440	696440	Good.
696440	698440	Okay.
