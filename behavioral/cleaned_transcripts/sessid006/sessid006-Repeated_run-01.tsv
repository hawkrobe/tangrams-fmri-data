0	28360	Okay, this looks like somebody that's kneeling.
28600	33080	They have a diamond head and it's a triangle that's returning to the right.
35560	39480	So a diamond head stacked on top of another diamond, it looks like a kneeling person
40600	43000	and they're like two triangular shapes on the right hand side.
53640	55960	Looks like they're kneeling, are there two triangle shapes on both?
56920	60360	Yeah, it kind of looks like somebody's kneeling looking upwards almost,
60360	67160	but yeah, a diamond sort of head and then there's two triangular shapes that are pictured into the
67160	77560	right.
83000	86920	This looks almost like a candlestick, but it has another shape off to the left, so
87640	97320	okay, overall a candle. Yeah, awesome.
100280	111320	This looks like a bunny rabbit and it has a triangular shaped body.
117800	131320	This looks like somebody riding a horse or a bull and it has a triangle as a tail.
138520	144040	Okay, this has a diamond as a head. It's attached to something that looks kind of like
144520	148520	a trapezoid. If you want to think about it as a person,
148520	152440	it looks like somebody has one knee out and is stepping forward.
165000	167880	This looks like somebody that's shrugging. What's running?
168520	172840	Shrugging, yeah, has a diamond shaped head and it's kind of tilted.
188360	193240	This also looks somewhat like a candlestick figure, so it has a diamond head, but its body is thicker
194200	199080	and it's not regularly shaped, so the left-hand side is completely straight as a line,
199080	201480	but the right-hand side has some curves on it.
215080	218920	This looks like a ghost or like a tulip-shaped flower.
218920	226280	It's angled towards the right, if that makes sense, so it's not perfectly symmetrical,
226280	229800	but the top looks like a tulip and there's some stuff on the right side.
242680	245320	This looks like a scale that's tilted off to the right.
248920	267160	This has a diamond as its head and then immediately off to the right there's a triangle,
267160	271480	but it's all attached to something that looks pretty irregularly shaped.
272040	278600	It almost looks like if it were a person, somebody with a ponytail,
278600	285800	so a diamond with a triangle attached to the right-hand side and just the rest of it just one big blob.
288360	291480	Sorry, it's just a diamond shape with a triangle
291960	294280	attached to the right-hand side in its bottom corner.
294280	297320	The bottom corner?
299560	301880	Yeah, so just looking at the diamond as a head,
301880	305720	it has an equilateral triangle that's attached to its bottom corner.
308280	310120	Is it one of the smaller ones?
310120	312920	It's one of the smaller ones. It's a little bit shorter than the other ones.
312920	328280	This looks like somebody that might be kicking something, so his left leg is slightly higher
328280	333880	than the right and he's standing on his right leg. There's a square off to the right-hand side,
333880	337960	but it looks like a person that's just lifting his leg up.
343560	351800	This looks like somebody with a diamond head that might be holding a bowl,
351800	356280	so there's a triangle on the left-hand side slightly below the diamond head.
360760	362120	What do you say they might be holding?
364120	368600	It's kind of like a person's shape, so he has a diamond head and then there's a triangle
368600	371960	slightly below him, almost like somebody is holding a cup or a glass.
383800	388520	This is a symmetrical shape. It looks like it's a diamond atop.
398840	409960	This looks like an upside-down pine tree. It's also a symmetrical shape.
417880	423960	This looks like somebody that is maybe walking, so their stride is split. If they have two legs,
423960	429320	it's split and it has a diamond head with a more triangular body.
441480	447320	This looks like a scuba diver, so their feet have little triangle slippers.
454840	461240	This looks like a swan or some sort of bird, so on the right-hand side
461240	464440	it should look like something with an animal with a long neck,
464440	467320	and there's a small triangle in the bottom left corner of the shape.
479880	482120	This looks like a crab and it's a symmetrical shape.
