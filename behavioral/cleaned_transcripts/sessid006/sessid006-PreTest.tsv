0	14320	The other bunny-looking one, there are two ears that are small triangles, and then on
14320	19840	the left side of the figure there's like a little square that's bouncing on top of another
19840	21840	triangle that's part of the body.
22240	24880	Oh sorry, it's not letting me move from left to right.
29920	30640	Okay, got it.
33360	36000	Is there a square on this one, Karina?
36000	38960	Yeah, there's a square on the left side.
38960	39680	Okay, got it.
39680	60080	It looks like a person holding a triangle, and it kind of looks like their knee is bent, so...
60080	60800	Okay, got it.
69680	82160	This one's skinny, but it's tilted, so it kind of looks like a pair of sunglasses.
83200	86080	Okay, I think I got it, got it.
96320	99280	This one's pretty symmetric, it's a hexagon that's flat.
99760	102160	And then on top of that there's a triangle and a square.
103360	104800	Can you say that one more time?
104800	110080	It's a flat hexagon on the bottom, and then on top of that there's a little triangle that is diving.
111600	112960	It's symmetric, you said?
112960	113280	Yeah.
113280	130400	Um, looks like a person riding a horse or something.
130400	130640	Okay.
131760	136160	And the horse has a little triangle for a tail, and a triangle for a head.
136160	136880	Got it.
143280	152000	Looks like a figure that's standing up has like a square for a head,
152800	156800	and two little triangles for feet that look like flippers.
159120	160400	Okay, got it.
160400	172560	Ooh, there are two heads in this one.
172560	176320	There is one diamond and one upside-down triangle.
180960	186160	They're on like different levels, so the diamond is toward the right and it's tall,
186720	189520	and the upside-down triangle is on the left and it's shorter.
189520	190240	Got it, okay.
190400	205040	Um, just one head in this one.
205040	208480	It's a diamond that's slightly to the left.
209680	214880	Um, it's on top of like a triangle-y thingy that melts into the body.
217280	217520	Okay.
220400	232240	This one's another house, and there's a big tall rectangle to the right of it.
234160	235040	Got it.
235040	254000	It kind of looks again like someone riding a horse, except this time the person's head
254000	258880	is just on top of a parallelogram.
265040	275920	It looks fairly almost symmetric.
275920	281200	There are like three points, except it's coming out of something on the right side.
287440	294640	Looks kind of like a ghost coming out of, um, like a bottle or something.
294640	295280	It's symmetric.
295280	307520	Oh, I see, okay.
311040	313680	Looks like, um, some sort of animal.
313680	318640	It has two legs and a tall neck and a head on the left side.
320800	321520	Okay, um.
324640	325920	Oh yeah, those are similar.
332960	340560	Looks like a very squat person holding, like, a book.
341360	343440	Um, their lower body.
343440	353920	Oh, shoot, okay.
354880	356240	Very strange looking.
356240	362880	There's a diamond head, and then below that there's kind of a weird quadrilateral,
363440	365440	another weird quadrilateral below that.
365440	366800	It's very asymmetric.
367360	371200	And then a triangle and a little triangle on the bottom right corner.
374640	377520	Okay, it has a diamond at the top?
377520	377840	Yeah.
384640	398880	Looks like a seesaw that's been turned lopsided towards the right.
398880	399360	Got it.
410480	414320	Um, kind of just looks like a potato that grew a diamond for a head.
414640	434320	Okay, this is another one that looks like someone holding a book, except their upper
434320	439520	body is, like, stretched and the book is a square on, like, the bottom left, but they're
439520	440480	kind of, like, bent over.
440480	444240	And they have a triangle for a head?
445200	445680	Yeah.
457840	461120	Looks like someone balancing on one leg,
462640	466960	and they have two, like, triangles for arms and a diamond for a head.
466960	467280	Okay.
470480	479680	A rectangle with a long neck on the left side.
487440	488560	It kind of looks like an L?
489120	489360	Yeah.
501360	505440	Looks like someone shrugging, and they're kind of tilted.
507280	507680	Okay.
530480	537520	Good.
537520	541920	I don't know how hard it's supposed to be to hear, but I got a lot of noise in my ears,
541920	542240	too.
547680	548000	Yeah.
551040	551280	Good.
552480	552800	Okay.
555440	555840	Gotcha.
555840	556080	Okay.
