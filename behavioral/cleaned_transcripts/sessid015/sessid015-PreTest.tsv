0	20240	Okay, so to me it looks like someone is like a diver, there's like two triangles right
20240	26960	at the bottom, it's all centered, and then kind of like it moves the whole way up from
26960	32720	the bottom middle to the top middle, and there's like two, to me they're like kind of arms
32720	39760	coming off from the right hand side, with like a block at the top, and then like a thinner,
39760	45440	longer rectangle that goes into a triangle on the left hand side, yes on the back, yeah.
45440	51040	I think I got it. Okay, okay.
TRIAL2	62560	Okay, again I kind of see it, it's like a house on the right,
62560	65520	with like a mushroom, like a tree on the left hand side.
66480	68480	Okay,
79280	86320	ah okay, so using the same thing while I was using like the body before, this one's like
87360	90960	someone who had some of the feet in the air, so it's like two smaller triangles
91600	96080	in the middle towards the top, moving down into two thicker ones towards the bottom,
96080	101760	one touching the bottom, one a bit more in the air, with like a block around halfway up.
102400	105920	Okay, does that make sense? Okay.
106560	122640	Okay, using the same analogy, this to me looks like someone on their knees, there's like a
122640	129280	triangle small to the left hand side, and then they pick up blocks to the right of that,
129920	136560	and then towards the top there's going to have two triangles coming out, one's a piggy flap,
136560	142080	one's slightly splatted up, like the head is between the two, tilted to the one point,
142080	148320	it's between the tip of the two triangles. I don't think there's anything else I could say,
148320	156640	it's all quite central, one of the shorter ones. Okay, yeah, okay.
159280	175200	Okay, so this I'm visualising as someone kind of with their hands out, so there's the tilted
176480	181840	square at the top, and it moves down, there's like one big block that goes the whole way down,
182400	187120	the little triangle right at the bottom, like a larger part that comes out on the left,
187840	202480	with like a square, there's like a bit on top which I'd use a bit firmer, all on the left, yeah.
207280	215360	Okay, so this kind of, this to me looks like someone wearing a horse in a way, I don't know,
215360	221840	so there's like a long body that runs from the left to the right, which has like a triangle on
221840	229520	the left hand side, tilted up, and another one on the right hand side is tilted more,
229520	236080	and only just the tip touches the rest of the body, it has like two legs on either side,
236080	242960	as if it's flicking that, and then there's in the centre, commuting upwards, there's a triangle,
243600	248320	there's a square attached to that, leading kind of forwards towards the left.
248320	277280	Okay, so right at the top of this one, there is a triangle with the pointing left, it's quite
277280	285040	small, and there's a longer body which runs down to the bottom, but the tip of the triangle at the
285040	292960	top is like the leftmost point, aligned with a kind of tilted square, which is near the bottom,
293760	297920	the rest is kind of like a, I don't know how to describe that shape, it's just like a
299680	303040	longer shape that has three things protruding out to it to the left,
303120	308000	the middle one has this like cube square sitting on it.
326160	329040	Okay, this is similar to one we had before,
330000	337440	where Tim here looks like some sort of animal, so there's a triangle at the far right,
338320	342800	which is slightly tilted down, and only just attached to the rest of the body,
343920	350720	that looks like it has two legs but mildly jumping towards the left, the far left side,
350720	358720	there's like two triangles protruding, coming up from the middle, there is a rectangular
358800	365840	shape that leans left, and then a square on top of that, that's all on top of the
368080	372320	kind of M-shaped body that runs from left to right.
372720	396560	Okay, so this one has like one arm that protrudes very clearly down towards the left-hand corner of
396560	402640	the image, it has like three main upper arms, one which is above it towards the top left,
403200	406320	and one towards the bottom right, which kind of arches down.
413600	416640	It has kind of like a right angled thing at the top,
419280	422160	there would be three different arms, top left,
422960	424080	bottom left, bottom right.
436400	445360	Okay, so at the top of this one, there is kind of the head-like square, and then it moves down
446320	449600	with two things protruding on the right-hand side,
451680	454640	which looks to me like knees and something with the kind of hands out,
456160	472560	and then it kind of goes back towards the left right at the bottom.
472960	483680	Okay, so again, at the top of this one, there is a square which has like a diamond shape,
483680	488960	and slightly off-center towards the right, and then the rest of the thing that runs down,
488960	496400	looks kind of like a tree to me, it has like a flatter side about halfway up on the left,
497040	501120	and then it continues as a whole body the whole way down, and then it kind of goes out at the
501120	508800	bottom, yeah. I'm feeling like a kind of numbness in one of my hands, like a pins and needles type
508800	514560	thing, I don't know if that's... What did you say? I was just trying to say to people that I'm
514560	520640	feeling like a numbness in one of my hands, like a pins and needles type thing, I don't know if I
520640	533680	can say it very good. So this looks very clear in the way that it has two legs, like shoes,
533680	542560	one is planted on the floor, one is going up towards the left, and then above that there is
543520	550880	like a diamond shape like appearing over the side on the left, and a square on the right,
550880	554400	it looks like it's sliding off, like it would just fall off on the right.
554400	573040	Okay, this one again has kind of the same diamond thing right at the top, slightly off center to the left,
574160	580080	and then it has a kind of strange shape, I don't know how to describe it,
580880	587760	there's like a diamond right onto like a flat line, on the left this goes straight down,
587760	592800	then there's a gap and it goes to like an arrow thing, on the right from the top it starts
592800	598080	protruding out, immediately goes towards the left, and then there's like a long line down towards the
598080	603600	right, where there's actually kind of two gaps sticking out, I don't know how to describe this one, it's a bit strange.
609680	618240	Yeah, I'm not really sure which one this is. Okay, so it's like a block that has
619840	627120	two legs, one of them is more very, one's straight, one's kind of like, kind of arched in a way,
628240	632400	kind of like a claw, that's the one on the left-hand side.
649120	655440	Okay, this one has a quite solid rectangular shape at the bottom,
656240	663760	protruding out, it goes on the left-hand side, up towards the top, in a triangle, right at the top, going left.
672960	677840	It's one of the more simplistic shapes. One of the what? It's one of the simpler shapes,
677840	683760	it's kind of just like the one big block at the bottom, and up it goes, up towards the top.
683920	684420	Okay.
698800	708720	Okay, so in the end, it has the kind of diamond thing in the middle of, well it has to just be
708720	712640	one rectangle, it has like a bite out of it on the right-hand side.
714240	719440	It's the best way to explain it. Otherwise it would be like just one rectangle.
729760	736560	Not really sure which one this is. Okay, so again it's one of the more simplistic ones,
737440	739520	it's the diamond on top of a
741600	746960	T-shape, which is completely flat on the left-hand side when it comes up to the bottom.
747760	751600	The same on the top and the bottom, but the top is longer than the bottom,
752640	757280	but the right one kind of like arches down. This? Yes, that's what I call it.
766960	772560	Okay, um, to me, it's one of the most simplistic ones again. It looks like a crab to me.
773280	779280	Oh yeah, I think I know which one you're talking about. Okay, cool. Yeah, all right.
779280	800640	Um, okay, so it has the diamond thing at the top, and it probably just connects onto...
800720	806800	I think it kind of looks like a mean person. This one's a bit hard.
807600	819600	Um, the shape at the bottom is kind of like a triangle, which has a flat side when it
820960	824880	tops the bottom on the left and stops just shy of like a bird, I would say.
825760	830560	Um, on the bottom, it kind of runs in the middle part, and then it kind of goes up a little bit,
831360	837840	the whole like a D-type shape to me. Um, this one's a little bit difficult, I don't know what to say.
841840	849840	Oh, okay.
850400	860800	This is like a house sort of on the left, and then a chimney or like a tall tower to the right.
861680	881520	Um, this one is very narrow, very central. Um, like a thin line that runs down with two
882480	896240	like kind of... A triangle, I think? Yeah, kind of perverse, yeah. Yeah, okay.
899920	906720	Um, it's kind of quite simplistic. There's a diamond thing on the top, and then one kind of
906720	914400	body that runs down, kind of triangle at the top, that runs down top to bottom, and then right at
914400	918800	the bottom it kind of goes towards the right. It's kind of like a kingfisher that moves towards the
918800	928880	right.
936400	942880	This was... I guess I did say what we were supposed to say, this is the one you did before.
943840	948960	Yeah, yeah, the same shape. Okay.
953040	962960	Cool.
972960	977760	I can't really kill them that well. Can I overkill them? I don't know if they can hear me,
977760	984640	but I'm just going to say it anyway. Um, this one, diamond shape on the top, long,
984640	989280	protruding thing about halfway down the left-hand side, and the right one goes,
989280	994880	the right side goes right down the bottom right corner, and there's like a little triangle at
994880	1004960	the bottom right. Okay, all right, that's fine.
1013520	1020480	Um, okay. I know there's someone dancing to me, so it has like the diamond head at the top,
1021200	1025440	but it's not kind of pointed up like the rest, it's more to one side,
1025440	1030320	so it's basically, would be kind of flat, but it's very slightly down.
1031040	1034000	Um, it's right, it's kind of on the right side, it's connected to
1035360	1039920	kind of a thin part, which then runs down into a bigger block at the bottom,
1040000	1044560	just a triangle on the right, and it's not going to be the part on the left.
1045600	1053360	Okay.
1062880	1067360	Um,
1068320	1072960	so there's like the, the diamond heads, a little bit lower than the other ones,
1073600	1079440	it looks like two arms reaching up, the one on the right is more diamond-y,
1079440	1083680	the one on the left is more flat, but it has like a body shape that runs
1084400	1089920	from the top left to the top bottom, top right, sorry, top left, bottom right.
1089920	1091440	Does it almost look like it's flying?
1092640	1093920	Like it's what, sorry?
1093920	1094800	Like it's flying?
1095600	1102240	Yeah.
1108080	1114320	Um, this looks like some sort of bird creature, it has like a,
1116480	1118160	like a swan swimming?
1118160	1118880	Yes, yeah.
1125520	1139360	Okay, this looks like someone dancing with one foot planted, one foot is out to the right.
1139360	1141520	And their arms are to the left?
1141520	1142240	Yes, correct.
1144240	1150240	Okay, this one as well.
1150800	1158320	Okay, this looks like someone walking towards the left with a, like a large pace.
1159920	1165200	Okay, um, do their legs kind of make like a 90 degree angle?
1166480	1173680	Yeah, in a way, the one on the right is more flat at the bottom, the one on the left, yeah.
1180320	1190240	Okay, this is not really creeping as a shape, it runs from the top left to the bottom right,
1191120	1196000	um, and it's kind of like a single block that kind of wiggles in a way,
1196000	1198320	the top right and the bottom left kind of have these triangles,
1198320	1203680	because like they're kind of like folded over, and there's two like, yeah.
1210480	1218480	Okay, this looks kind of like the crab creature with a tail,
1219840	1224080	and a more pronounced head, and it's some other sort of animal.
1224720	1227520	Is the tail pointing to the right?
1227520	1235680	It does, yeah, it comes down towards the right.
1240640	1246480	This is like someone who is kind of sat down and lounged against the wall,
1246480	1249920	and their knees are bent, and their feet down at the bottom left corner,
1249920	1253680	their head kind of tilting down.
1264720	1267520	This looks like a prancing horse, um,
1267600	1270000	the bottom left leg goes a lot lower than the right one,
1270640	1274960	it's got like a tail that goes up on the far right side.
1285040	1287440	This one doesn't really look like anything, but it's like,
1288000	1292320	it's got the square bit at the top which is completely centered and flat,
1292960	1296240	and there's like two diamonds that are kind of overlapping each other.
1296800	1303680	Oh, yeah.
1310160	1314240	Um, this kind of looks like a UFO,
1314880	1318960	it's like a disc that runs across the bottom, but with a diamond on top.
1326960	1327460	Um,
1335360	1338240	first thing I can think of, it looks like an anvil that's on its side,
1338240	1339920	like one of the woodworking things,
1339920	1341760	so it's got like a diamond bit at the bottom,
1342400	1345840	and then a flat bar that's kind of on top of the diamond shape,
1345840	1351440	and there are two arms, one of which is kind of pointy, one is flat,
1351440	1355840	and it's tilted to the, um, kind of leaning towards the bottom right.
1356240	1357040	Okay, cool.
1365760	1366260	Um,
1368560	1373280	it's the only one in which the diamond head has kind of like buddy ears.
1378320	1379520	Wait, what was that?
1379520	1383600	There's kind of like the diamond head thing that has two triangles coming out of it.
1384320	1386640	Oh, okay, it's like out of the top.
1386640	1388640	Oh, yeah.
1402640	1406720	Okay, this looks, again, kind of like a dog,
1406720	1410240	he's coming up to his owner, like towards the right,
1410240	1412720	so like you have like a triangle tail on the left hand side.
1412720	1413760	Okay, cool.
