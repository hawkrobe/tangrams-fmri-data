0	27000	Okay, this, again, looks like the password button in the hall, so it's the only one.
TRIAL2	29000	Okay.
29000	49000	Um, this is the one I said was a dancer again, where I had the longer sweeping leg on the
49000	59000	left-hand side of the small triangle on the right.
59000	69000	Um, this is the one with the guy with the knees, like, kind of bent on the right-hand
69000	78000	side, with, like, the arms kind of out towards the right as well.
78000	81000	Okay.
81000	92000	This is the, kind of, more coquettish one that you didn't get last time, with the small
92000	94000	triangle on the right side.
94000	100000	The small right triangle, not, like, the, has, like, a big protruding thing on the left-hand
100000	101000	side.
101000	104000	Um, the diamond on the top.
104000	108000	Is that, is that an actual diamond?
109000	111000	Yeah, maybe a little more.
111000	112000	Okay.
112000	117000	So right at the bottom of the right-hand side, there's, like, a small triangle with a point
117000	118000	downwards.
118000	119000	Um.
119000	124000	And it connects to, like, a bigger base, like a triangle pointing upwards.
124000	131000	It's connected to, kind of, like, two arms, one that runs towards the left, like, maybe
131000	136000	in the middle, and then one that, kind of, goes towards the right, but less so.
136000	138000	And then a diamond shape on top.
138000	139000	Oh, okay.
139000	142000	Is it the one with the platform?
142000	144000	Yeah, on the left-hand side, yeah.
144000	145000	Oh, okay.
155000	162000	This is the, kind of, like, prancing horse with the left-hand side, like, big lower.
166000	176000	This is the house with the tree on the left.
176000	196000	This is the, the one with the center palace one, where, like, it has the diamond on the
196000	201000	top, kind of, love in the middle, and then it, like, slightly turns towards the right
201000	203000	at the end.
204000	206000	Does that make sense?
206000	207000	Um.
209000	212000	Like, a triangle, I think, towards the bottom on the right.
212000	218000	It's, like, connected to one big body that runs towards the top.
218000	219000	Is that?
219000	220000	Yeah, probably.
220000	221000	That's the hard one.
221000	222000	Yeah.
222000	235000	Yeah, this is the dancer, the foot out towards the right, and the two hands to the left.
235000	254000	This is, I can call this the, like, Baby Yona one, like, the person with the hands out
254000	258000	on the left-hand side with the little feet.
258000	260000	What was that?
260000	264000	That's, like, the one which is, like, I can call it Baby Yona or something.
264000	265000	Oh, yeah.
265000	266000	Yeah, yeah.
278000	282000	Okay, this is the kind of weird, doesn't really have a shape one that runs from the top left
282000	284000	to the bottom right.
284000	285000	The squiggle?
285000	286000	Yeah.
294000	307000	Okay, this is the more simple one with the big block at the bottom and the thinner rectangle
307000	312000	running from the left to the top with the, yeah, rabbits.
312000	327000	This is the one which is, like, kind of a man side against the wall with his knees bent.
327000	328000	Okay.
328000	346000	This is the one with the two triangles running at the top with the tips only just connected
346000	348000	to the rest of it.
348000	373000	This is the one with the two big, thicker triangles towards the bottom with, like, the
373000	376000	head thing, like, kind of halfway up.
376000	378000	It's like the M1 but take away the M triangle.
378000	379000	Oh, yeah.
379000	380000	Okay, cool.
389000	394000	This is the, like, I think I call it, like, the backward seven type shape.
394000	395000	Yeah.
395000	396000	Yeah.
396000	397000	Yeah, cool.
407000	411000	This is the other house with the tool one on the right.
411000	412000	Okay.
412000	432000	The thin one with the two shapes coming out on either side, one on either side, rather.
432000	433000	Okay.
433000	460000	This is the one with the two triangles coming out on either side, one on either side, rather.
460000	462000	Okay.
462000	464000	Yeah.
464000	466000	Yeah.
466000	468000	Yeah.
468000	470000	Yeah.
470000	472000	Yeah.
