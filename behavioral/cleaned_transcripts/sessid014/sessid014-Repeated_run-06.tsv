0	29000	This is the guy who's either having a good time or is flying, the one we disagreed about.
TRIAL2	42000	This is the one that's symmetrical at the top and then juts out at the bottom. It has those two kind of triangular cutouts at the top. Kind of looks like a ghost.
49000	55000	This one is the bamboo shoot or the lamppost with all the speakers.
59000	68000	This is the horse that has no front legs.
79000	84000	This is the pine cone. It's got the flat square at the top.
89000	99000	This is the person sitting with their back to the wall on the right of them. They've got their head tilted down.
108000	116000	This is the cliff that has a very flat side on the left and then a jagged side on the right and you've got like a square at the top of it.
119000	134000	This is the other cliff that has the square pushing the triangle off of it to the left or to the right. That's the right.
134000	149000	This is the symmetrical shape that's hard to describe. It has the trapezoidal cutout at the very top.
149000	165000	This is the house with the spokestack to the right of it. Tall. Yeah.
165000	180000	This is the giraffe with no legs or I guess the tracheosaurus with no legs.
180000	205000	This is the person holding a wide glass with the long robe. The wide glass is like a tiny little upside down triangle off to the left and it has a square head pointed to the top.
206000	217000	This one is the ballerina. It's got the leg pointing out and behind him to the right. Two arms cut out to the front.
217000	232000	This is the hard to describe figure with the tiny triangle head and it looks like it's holding a box.
232000	259000	This is the person wearing a skirt and kind of sitting down. She's got her foot out. It's like a little triangle pointing down.
259000	288000	This is the scuba diver. This one is the shrimp or the gun. Kind of curves around.
289000	316000	This is the one that I got wrong. It's the dancer. She's got the long train on her skirt to the back.
