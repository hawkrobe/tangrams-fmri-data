14000	43000	Okay, this one has the square diamond head shape, like, pointed up towards the top,	1
43000	44000	like, specially at the top.	1
44000	49000	And then it has, like, a trapezoid kind of jutting out to the left.	1
49000	53000	And at the very, very bottom of this shape is a little tiny triangle pointed down.	1
53000	59000	It's kind of hard to describe overall, but, like, at the bottom right is a tiny pointed	 1
59000	60000	down triangle.	1
60000	64000	And then that kind of connects to a larger triangle that's pointed upwards, and that	1
64000	67000	connects to the main part of the shape.	1
67000	81000	This one is the house with the smokestack to the right of it.	2
91000	95000	Okay, this one is the one with the square pushing the triangle off the cliff, right?	3
95000	101000	To the left it's a very jagged, like, cliff-like shape, and then the right has, like, the square	3
101000	104000	at the very top, and then the triangle being pushed off.	3
112000	118000	This one is the person sitting with their back to something to the right of them, and	4
118000	121000	it's got, like, their head tilted down to the left, and their knees kind of stretched	4
121000	123000	to the left.	4
131000	134000	This one is the horse without any front legs, right?	5
134000	138000	It's got that triangle top head part, and then it's...	5
148000	150000	This is the person with the wine glass, right?	6
150000	152000	It's got the, yeah...	6
161000	165000	Okay, this is the one that we said is really hard to describe, and it's got, like, the	7
165000	167000	very jagged top.	7
167000	170000	It's got, like, two triangle cutouts for the top, and then it has...	7
170000	174000	So it has the symmetrical top, and then, like, the piece sticking out from the bottom.	7
183000	188000	This is the shrimp for the gull, kind of...	8
191000	204000	Okay, this is the really hard to describe symmetrical one with the trapezoid cutout	9
204000	206000	at the top.	9
206000	221000	This is the very tall vertical...	10
221000	225000	I called it a lamppost with, like, speakers jumping out of it, but you...	10
225000	237000	Okay, this is the one that I got wrong.	11
237000	242000	It's the dancer one with, like, the long, train, flowy dress at the back of it.	11
242000	255000	This is the one that you disagreed with by assessment.	12
255000	258000	I called it, like, a flying person, but you said it was kind of just, like, a guy having	12
258000	259000	a good time.	12
259000	260000	He's got his arms up.	12
260000	273000	This is the giraffe, if you called it, or the brachiosaurus with no legs.	13
273000	284000	It's got, like, those tall big legs.	13
284000	289000	This is the ballerina with the leg out behind them to the right, and then, like, their two	14
289000	292000	arms sticking out to the left.	14
292000	305000	It's got that rhombus-shaped head.	14
305000	309000	Okay, this one is also very hard to describe.	15
309000	314000	At the very top, it has a tiny little triangle pointing to the left, and then, farther down,	15
314000	328000	it kind of looks like it's holding, like, a box or, like, that diamond square shape.	15
328000	332000	This is the one that kind of just looks like a square on a cliff, right?	16
332000	336000	The right side of the shape is very jagged, while the left side of the shape is very smooth,	16
336000	347000	and then at the very top of it is a square.	16
347000	349000	This is the pine cone, right?	17
349000	351000	It's very symmetrical.	17
351000	365000	It's got, like, a square at the top and two...	17
365000	369000	This is the one you call the scuba diver, which is a much better assessment than a	18
369000	397000	fish wearing a top hat.	18
397000	406000	Yep.	18
