0	14000	Okay, this is the person, the hardened scribe one, a small triangle face where they're carrying
14000	15000	a block.
TRIAL2	35000	Okay, this is the giraffe, no legs, square body.
36000	52000	Alright, this is the bamboo shoot, or the telephone pole, with speakers.
52000	57000	This is, oh, new one, oh boy, okay.
57000	65000	So this one is symmetrical, and to me it looks like a monk meditating from, you're facing
65000	69000	them from like forward, and they have a diamond face.
69000	73000	They're sitting on the ground, they're meditating.
80000	84000	Okay, this is the diamond on the cliff.
84000	88000	The left side of the cliff is flat, the right side is more jagged.
88000	92000	Diamond is sticking straight up on the flat plane.
99000	102000	The one you got wrong, or the one that describes wrong.
102000	107000	You don't have to assign agency, you know.
107000	111000	It's the flowy dress out to the left.
111000	113000	And, yeah.
122000	127000	Alright, this is the symmetric one, but the trap is always cut out of it.
127000	130000	Semi-hard to describe, I guess.
130000	134000	Um, yep.
140000	145000	A house with smokestacks, very tall smokestack.
145000	148000	Uh, this is a new one.
148000	152000	It looks like a dog healing, in my opinion.
152000	154000	It doesn't have a tail.
154000	158000	It's like a dog kind of stretching, pushing back.
158000	163000	The top is a parallelogram, the dog's face is a parallelogram.
163000	166000	Yep.
166000	169000	Alright, this is the hard to describe.
169000	174000	It's symmetric at the top, and at the bottom, to the right, it's jutting out.
174000	177000	The thing is jutting out.
184000	188000	Alright, the dog's face is a parallelogram.
188000	191000	The dog's face is a parallelogram.
191000	195000	Alright, this is one we haven't really talked about.
195000	197000	Oh, there's a new one.
197000	203000	To me, it looks like a zombie with his head falling off, and he's walking to the left.
203000	209000	So, yeah, and his arms are raised, but then the cloth is falling down to the left.
209000	213000	You know, it's walking, it's, yeah.
214000	216000	Alright, this is one we just reviewed on.
216000	219000	It's the flying person having a good time.
219000	225000	Uh, you know, both arms raised out to the heavens.
225000	230000	Diamond is, diamond head is, yep.
234000	237000	Alright, this is the person's face.
237000	242000	Alright, this is the person sitting down as they're back against the wall.
242000	248000	To the right, the wall is flat, and to the right, and they are looking down.
254000	260000	Alright, this is the ballerina dancer with their arms out to the left,
260000	264000	and with their legs lifted to the right.
270000	272000	Alright, new one.
272000	275000	Arrow is pointing upwards to the left.
275000	277000	It's a house next to a house.
277000	280000	So a house with an arrow next to it.
280000	284000	Alright, this is very, you described it, it's also a new one,
284000	287000	and you described it as very geometric and hard to describe.
287000	290000	I would also agree with that.
290000	293000	To the left, it's kind of triangular.
293000	301000	To the right, it's like a diagonal rectangle with an arrow next to it.
301000	304000	Alright, this is the horse with no legs.
306000	308000	Or one leg, sorry, one leg.
308000	311000	But the two legs of each other.
311000	327100	And it's moving towards the
327100	330340	side, moving towards the other side of the horse.
330340	349860	Alright, this is another new one, it's a person walking to the left, their left foot has a
349860	354140	little triangle on it, but their right foot doesn't really have that triangle, it's more
354140	369180	of just a parallelogram, and they're pointing to the left. Alright, this is, I'm gonna call it a nun,
369180	376300	a nun praying to the right, and her legs are kind of lifted behind her, she's not squatting down,
376300	390100	she's kneeling down, and her legs are lifted behind her. Alright, this kind of looks like,
390100	399140	I think you described it as someone doing kung fu or something, or they could be dancing,
399140	410340	they have a upright diamond head, also this is new, and their right foot is, or like, you know,
410340	416180	when we're looking at it, on the right, their foot is pointed lower than their left foot,
416180	423260	and they're kind of dancing or fighting of some sort. They have arms pointing out to the right,
423380	437380	or just one arm, I guess. Everything on the left is kind of flat. Alright, another new one,
437380	446060	we got a dog riding a bigger dog, not the person riding the horse, but the dog riding a bigger dog.
453260	459980	Alright, this is the person, another new one, she described as having a bow in her hair,
459980	468700	yeah, and she's kind of sitting down with the wall against the left side of her, she's looking down.
468700	494180	Alright, this is the person riding the horse, or it could be a dog, I don't know,
494340	499380	some sort of animal, there's a person on it, and the person's body is a triangle.
506580	509380	Alright, this is the horse, she's having a good time, you know,
510260	527060	its tail is raised. Alright, this is another new one, hard to describe. I would say the head
527620	534420	is actually like two triangles, and they're kind of like kicking a square back, and the square is
534420	540500	on the left, and this person is kicking the square, maybe it's a soccer ball, you know.
547540	556100	Alright, another new one, he described it as the arm is drapey, you know, the cloth on the arm
556100	562740	is drapey, they're pointed to the left, diamond head, they're like giving an offering of some sort,
562820	567220	maybe, again with like a robe on, so the, yeah.
574660	580100	Alright, so this is the nun, so she's done praying, now she's just squatting a little bit,
580100	586900	she's getting up, she's in the process of getting up, she's pointed to the right, and you know, okay.
593700	597380	Alright, this is the square pushing the triangle off the cliff,
598020	601780	the left side of the cliff is very more jagged than the right side,
601780	603540	but the right side is still a bit jagged.
612820	619220	Alright, this is the screwy diver, or the fish with the top hat. Um, vice? Oh, sorry.
623700	629620	The scuba diver, or fish with top hat. Um, triangle legs, I guess, or triangle feet?
637780	642340	Alright, this is a new one, it's a swan laying a triangle egg.
644260	649300	Um, maybe not a swan, some big bird of some sort.
652740	665300	Um, pine cone? Um, yeah, square top, symmetrical.
673380	679780	Alright, this is, uh, you said the word toilet in your description, I have to agree, I think,
680420	684020	but it's not really that they're sitting in the toilet, you know, it's kind of like standing
685060	687620	within the toilet. Okay, yeah.
693860	700500	Alright, wine glass person with a long robe. Um, and, uh, yeah.
700500	715620	Alright, this is the swaddled baby, um, as you described. Uh, try, uh, yeah, square head.
