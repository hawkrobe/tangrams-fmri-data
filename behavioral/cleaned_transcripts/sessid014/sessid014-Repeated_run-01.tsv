30000	35000	Okay, um, this one looks like a bamboo shoot.	1
35000	40000	Or you described it at the telephone pole, with two speeders coming out of it.	1
40000	45000	Um, yes, very vertical.	1
45000	50000	Yeah.	2
54000	56000	Okay, this one looks like a shrimp.	2
56000	58000	Yes, the shrimp?	2
58000	60000	Yeah, the shrimp. And the gun.	2
70000	75000	This one, you described it as a fish, but I think it's more of it as a scuba diver.	3
75000	77000	Oh shoot!	3
79000	81000	That was the wrong button.	3
81000	92000	Uh, this one looks like the dancer with the mulling dress out to the left.	4
92000	98000	Um, has a square tilted slightly to the left.	4
98000	103000	Uh, has the head out to the right. There's a triangle.	4
103000	105000	Uh, that's perfect.	4
106000	108000	Shit.	4
114000	116000	Oh, yeah.	5
116000	118000	Um, this one's the pine cone.	5
118000	120000	Uh, very symmetrical.	5
120000	123000	Uh, what else?	5
123000	126000	Square on top, flat square.	5
126000	133000	Uh, and then zigzaggy on both sides.	5
133000	137000	Uh, flat square on the top, symmetrical.	5
144000	151000	Okay, this one has a small triangle pointing to the left as the head,	6
151000	156000	and at the bottom it's carrying a little square to the left.	6
156000	158000	Yeah.	6
164000	175000	Okay, this one, um, it's a square head diamond on a flat clip.	7
175000	183000	Um, it's flat on the left, and then to the right it's a bit more jagged.	7
184000	186000	And go.	7
192000	199000	Okay, this one is kind of hard to describe, but on top, um,	8
199000	202000	for like the first half it's pretty symmetrical,	8
202000	206000	but then there's something that jumps out at the bottom to the right.	8
206000	209000	Um, and there's a triangle on top.	8
209000	211000	It's very jagged on top.	8
211000	216000	It is symmetrical on top, but then, you know, it jumps out to the right.	8
222000	224000	Okay, this is the house with the smoke stack.	9
224000	228000	Um, pretty straightforward.	9
229000	233000	Okay, uh, there's a lot going on in this one.	10
233000	239000	Um, it looks like a, uh, a person with a skirt sitting down.	10
239000	244000	Uh, there's feet out to the right, and there's a upright diamond head,	10
244000	247000	or, you know, the square diamond head.	10
247000	250000	Um, there's something pointing out to the left.	10
250000	255000	Uh, and, you know, there's something pointing out to the left.	10
255000	258000	Uh, and her arms are kind of pointed to the right.	10
258000	263000	So she's wearing a, and the skirt is like a, it's like a upright triangle.	10
263000	265000	It's like a big upright triangle.	10
265000	268000	And she has feet out to the bottom right,	10
268000	273000	and her head is a, uh, a diamond, a meaningful square, you know,	10
273000	276000	square diamond, and it's upright.	10
276000	278000	And, uh, yeah, her.	10
278000	280000	Okay.	10
280000	283000	Okay, uh, there's a lot going on in this one, too.	11
283000	286000	It's, it's, it's kind of like a jagged clip.	11
286000	291000	Um, and to the left, there's a lot more jagged stuff on this clip,	11
291000	293000	and there's a square on top,	11
293000	296000	and it's pushing off a triangle to the right.	11
296000	302000	Um, yeah, and the square is tilted, yeah.	11
302000	304000	Okay.	11
305000	308000	This one is the arabesque dancer,	12
308000	311000	with the feet pointing to the right.	12
311000	315000	And, um, yeah.	12
321000	322000	All right.	12
322000	326000	This one is the arabesque dancer,	12
326000	329000	and it's pointing to the left.	12
329000	332000	And, um, yeah.	12
332000	333000	All right.	12
333000	337000	This one, uh, I disagree with the way you described this.	13
337000	340000	I mean, it looks like, you said it looks like someone with wings	13
340000	342000	trying to, uh, fly away.	13
342000	345000	I think it's more of a guy just, you know, having a good time.	13
345000	350000	Uh, his arms are raised, and it's a, uh, parallelogram.	13
350000	353000	The body is a giant parallelogram pointed to the right.	13
353000	357000	The head is a diamond tilting to the left.	13
357000	360000	Um, and, you know, it's got the wings or the arms,	13
360000	363000	uh, out raised, out stretched, you know.	13
363000	365000	Um.	13
371000	373000	Okay, this is a giraffe with a brachiosaurus.	14
373000	376000	Um, square body on the bottom.	14
376000	378000	Uh, very long neck.	14
378000	380000	And, cool.	14
380000	383000	Oh, this is the person sitting down, uh,	15
383000	385000	when the ball is on the right.	15
385000	388000	So you can see the, it's flat on the right.	15
388000	391000	The head is tilted down slightly to the left.	15
391000	393000	Um, their legs are bent.	15
393000	395000	It's a triangle at the bottom.	15
395000	398000	Um, uh, yeah.	15
404000	407000	Okay, this is a very small giraffe.	16
408000	412000	Okay, this is a very symmetrical, hard-to-describe one.	16
412000	417000	Um, however, there is a trapezoid cut out from the top of it.	16
417000	420000	Um, and, yeah, it's symmetrical.	16
420000	423000	Uh, yeah.	16
428000	431000	Okay, this, uh...	17
433000	436000	Oh, wine glass. Yeah, person with a wine glass.	17
436000	439000	Um, the upright diamond head.	17
439000	442000	Um, and the wine glass is to the left.	17
450000	452000	Okay, this is a horse without a leg.	18
452000	456000	Um, you know, it has the triangle head.	18
456000	459000	And to the right, it has the triangle foot.	18
459000	462000	Um, yeah.
