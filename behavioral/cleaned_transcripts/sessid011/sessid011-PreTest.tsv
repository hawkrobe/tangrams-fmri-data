0	23000	This one looks like a mouse, looking up to the top-right corner.
23000	24000	Uh-oh.
25000	28000	Yeah, there's a triangle here and a box here.
31000	36000	Um, what did you say after you said it looked like a mouse?
36000	39000	It's a mouse looking to the top-left corner.
40000	44000	Yeah, there's a triangle here and a box here.
54000	58000	The bottom-right corner looks cut off at its torso.
60000	63000	Um, can y'all make it a little bit louder?
65000	68000	Um, it's...
74000	78000	Yeah, to me it just looks like a mouse looking up to the top-left corner.
78000	93000	Uh, with a box here on the top of his head, a triangle here on the right of his head, um, stands out in the bottom-right corner, and it's cut off at the bottom-right corner at his torso.
98000	102000	Okay, what's at the bottom-right of his torso?
103000	105000	Um, that's where the image cuts off.
106000	119000	So, you can see him from his torso up with his front paws, front hands on the ground in the bottom-left, and his head in the top portion of the little brick.
132000	149000	Okay, can you, like, describe it a little bit more?
149000	172000	Uh, okay, it's, um, I've got a mouse that is suddenly, like, on their knees, sliding up to the bottom-right corner, um, with their arms sort of, like, flaring out to the left and the right.
173000	175000	Um...
178000	181000	I think I might have it.
182000	184000	Um...
184000	199000	This one looks kind of like a soccer player to me.
199000	220000	Um, they're running across the field, uh, towards the right, with their back where, um, in the bottom-left corner, um, it's a person, but it has, like, a flag around their waist, with their front arm pointing to the right.
221000	225000	Uh, okay, soccer player.
226000	233000	Their head is a diamond on a black surface, or a triangle that's pushed in the water.
235000	238000	Are there any squares in the picture?
239000	245000	Uh, only one square. It's the diamond head.
246000	256000	Uh, everything else looks like triangles, or the one, uh, crapazoid at the waist.
268000	277000	Little triangle pointing down, in the bottom-right corner, large triangle pointing up, connected to that.
277000	283000	Yeah, is it like, is it like an equilateral triangle, with the point, like, facing down?
284000	289000	Uh, yeah, the small triangle, yeah.
290000	292000	In the bottom-right corner.
292000	294000	Yay!
298000	307000	This one looks like a little kid riding a dog.
308000	321000	Um, you have a diamond at the top of a triangle, um, sort of slanting downward.
321000	332000	Or, in the far-right side, you have a triangle, a small triangle, uh, pointing to the bottom-right, but not directly up the bottom-right.
333000	335000	And that's about halfway up the right.
340000	342000	Ooh.
344000	346000	Okay, can you describe it more?
347000	354000	There's a medium-sized triangle connected at a point to the smaller triangle.
354000	365000	The mid-sized triangle is pointing with, uh, is pointing directly towards the, uh, smaller triangle.
365000	369000	So one of the points is pointing directly towards the bottom-right.
370000	379000	And then, there's a sort of inverted arrow on the left side.
383000	385000	Wait, what's on the left side?
386000	407000	There's another small triangle pointing up towards the square at an angle, and the sort of body of dog is an arrow pointing to the left of the tree.
408000	428000	Okay, um, is there a trapezoid that has, like, the parallel parts that are parallel to, like, the, like, uh, like, sides of the screen? Does that make sense?
429000	430000	No.
431000	433000	Okay, there isn't that?
433000	434000	No.
435000	437000	Okay, um...
448000	449000	Okay.
449000	454000	From the baseline horizontal, it's at, like, a 15 degree angle.
454000	456000	What about the horizontal?
456000	467000	From the baseline horizontal, uh, the image looks like it's tilted at, like, a 15 degree angle with the right side being lifted up.
467000	476000	Okay, and is there, like, in the middle, is there a square, like, along, like, a, like, a hill thing in a little bit of white space?
476000	477000	Yeah.
478000	479000	Okay.
479000	480000	Yep.
486000	487000	Okay.
492000	500000	This looks like a person holding their arms out, um, in sort of awe.
500000	516000	There's the parallelogram forming the body pointing to the bottom right with sort of, like, red heads as the arm and then, uh, square at an angle toward the head.
519000	524000	Um, does it look like a body with, like, two arms and a head?
525000	526000	Yes.
530000	531000	Um...
545000	550000	This one looks like it's bending down, so look at something on the floor.
550000	569000	There's a triangle pointing directly up at the top of the image, a triangle pointing to the bottom right corner, and then a trapezoid, uh, here at the top, and, uh, another parallelogram near the bottom.
574000	577000	It kind of looks like sunglasses that are functioning.
578000	580000	Like sunglasses?
580000	581000	Yeah.
583000	592000	But it's not the pair, it's like, it's not the pair of sunglasses, it looks like a magnet, it's the one that's, like, at an angle.
595000	596000	Uh...
600000	602000	Oh, okay, hold on.
607000	631000	Okay, is there, like, uh, like, like, depending on how you look at it, it could be, like, sort of, like, a left, on the left side, like, a right triangle with, like, a trapezoid then on it?
631000	632000	Yeah.
633000	634000	Okay.
637000	650000	This one looks like a battery with a smokestack on the left side.
650000	667000	Uh, it's a rectangle as a face, and then a rectangular, a thin rectangle pointing upwards on the left side, and a triangle connected at the top of that waiting to sort of glide.
668000	671000	Is this kind of, like, a chair?
671000	672000	Yeah.
680000	703000	Uh, for this one we have a rectangle on the left side facing up, and then an equilateral triangle at the bottom, rather like a toe.
703000	723000	A trapezoid directed to the right side, drop the toe to the top of the right cycle, and then another triangle forming sort of like an arc at the top of that, pointing to the right, and then a diamond at the top of all of it.
723000	736000	Can you describe the first part of that again?
736000	761000	It's a rectangle standing up, but its long way is vertical, a small triangle at the bottom of that to the right side forming the toe that's pointing to the right, and then a trapezoid on the right side of the rectangle above the initial triangle that I talked about.
762000	773000	A trapezoid on the right side of, what is it, uh...
773000	775000	You're on your flat.
803000	812000	Okay, sorry, I'm not, can you describe it more?
812000	817000	It's perfectly flat on the left side.
818000	839000	On the right side it has, if you were to like tilt your head, then you would see a decline, a straight line, a decline and an incline, with a diamond at the top of everything.
839000	847000	So the highest shape is a diamond?
847000	848000	Yep.
848000	859000	Okay.
859000	872000	And, okay, is it the one where, like, there's a rectangle and then like nothing really to the right of the rectangle?
872000	892000	No, there's a rectangle and nothing to the left of the rectangle.
892000	899000	Oh. Is it kind of like a rectangle that on the bottom right has like a bite out of it?
899000	900000	Yeah.
900000	916000	Okay.
916000	919000	This one looks like a whale jumping out of the water.
919000	932000	There is a long rectangle going vertically, two triangles at the bottom, and then some stuff going on in the middle.
932000	950000	Whale jumping out of water. Um, is it, is there like, kind of like an equilateral triangle in the middle and then like two more triangles, but like those two triangles are parallel, like they're bases?
950000	953000	Yeah.
953000	960000	And, okay, just to confirm, at the bottom right there's like a trapezoid kind of thing, if you know?
960000	961000	No.
961000	969000	No, okay.
969000	983000	There's a triangle pointing directly to the left at the bottom, and then to the right of that triangle there's another triangle pointing to the bottom left with a slight gap between them.
983000	993000	And then a trapezoid base sort of in the gap between those triangles.
993000	994000	Okay, so at the-
994000	996000	A rectangle that's pointing upwards.
996000	1003000	Okay, so there's like two triangles that like the tip of them is touching like the tip of a trapezoid?
1003000	1005000	Yep.
1005000	1009000	Oh.
1009000	1015000	Okay.
1015000	1018000	All right.
1018000	1024000	This one has three triangles, it kind of looks like a replica.
1024000	1034000	There's three triangles at the top, a slant to the bottom, and then a parallelogram at the very bottom pointing to the right.
1034000	1063000	It has the bulk of its area at the top, and then a sort of tail going out to the bottom right.
1063000	1066000	What's the highest shape?
1066000	1070000	The three triangles are all at the same height.
1070000	1074000	Okay, three triangles all at the same height.
1074000	1076000	Oh.
1076000	1082000	Okay, are two of the triangles like facing like opposite ways?
1082000	1083000	Yep.
1083000	1101000	Okay.
1101000	1104000	This one looks like a magnet or a bowl.
1104000	1118000	There's a trapezoid base, and then two parallelograms pointing inwards above that.
1118000	1122000	Okay, so what's above the trapezoid base?
1122000	1135000	Two parallelograms really small pointing towards each other on either edge of the trapezoid base.
1135000	1138000	It forms a sort of U.
1138000	1140000	Sort of what?
1140000	1163000	A U.
1163000	1166000	And what's the highest shape?
1166000	1179000	Two parallelograms at the same height pointing towards each other.
1179000	1191000	Oh, I see.
1191000	1206000	There's like a trapezoid with the shorter edge facing down, and like two rhombuses facing in towards each other.
1206000	1219000	Yep.
1219000	1223000	This one looks like a house or a barn with a silo next to it.
1223000	1245000	It's a long rectangle on the right sides pointing upwards so that's the length.
1245000	1249000	We have a triangle on the bottom right pointing to the bottom right.
1249000	1253000	A rhombus on the bottom left pointing to the bottom left.
1253000	1257000	A rhombus on the top left pointing left.
1257000	1273000	And then a sort of L connecting them all.
1273000	1293000	Kind of looks like a horse or a pips or a cow.
1293000	1301000	This is another baby riding a dog.
1301000	1317000	On the far right side you have a triangle pointing toward the top right at an angle that is connected to the rest of the frame only at one point so nothing else is touching.
1317000	1327000	The highest shape is a square pointing leftward a bit.
1327000	1333000	The lowest shape is a triangle pointing straight down.
1333000	1353000	And then two triangles on the leftmost end.
1353000	1355000	What did you say the highest shape was?
1355000	1358000	A square.
1358000	1361000	And what's the orientation of the square?
1361000	1379000	180 degrees tilted left.
1379000	1393000	But it's like is it but there's like still space above it like like um like just like white space above it it's not at the top of its box?
1393000	1395000	There is white space above it above it yeah.
1395000	1421000	It's right below the top square is a rhombus that is placed slightly below the next highest triangle.
1421000	1435000	This is the one that you selected in the whale with the two triangles at the top of a trapezoid.
1451000	1464000	Two triangles at the top of a trapezoid.
1464000	1467000	What's the orientation of the triangles?
1467000	1469000	The triangles are at the very top.
1469000	1475000	They're they look like they're sort of falling off in the left end of the image.
1476000	1491000	The bottom lowest shape is another rhombus with one of its faces parallel to the right.
1491000	1493000	There is a square in the middle.
1493000	1507000	This is a bigger triangle right below that.
1507000	1510000	And are there like the two triangles at the top?
1510000	1521000	Yep.
1521000	1532000	And the bottom like shape is like a like tilted towards the right like in a diagonal way.
1532000	1556000	Triangle at the top left of the frame pointing up.
1556000	1561000	Triangle at the bottom left of the frame pointing left.
1561000	1566000	Triangle at the mid right side of the frame pointing down.
1566000	1583000	And then a rhombus pointing up to the right at the very end on the right side.
1583000	1600000	Can you describe the triangles again?
1600000	1605000	Top left corner there is a triangle pointing directly up.
1605000	1611000	In the bottom left corner there is a triangle pointing left.
1611000	1633000	And on the right side of the image there is it looks like a horse altogether.
1634000	1644000	On the bottom left corner we have a really big triangle pointing inwards towards what looks like a phone.
1644000	1656000	The triangle at the left side has one point facing directly left, one point facing directly to the bottom.
1656000	1663000	And then the third point facing up towards the top right corner.
1663000	1672000	Is it like a small triangle that's like in the bottom left that's not really a part of like the rest of the shape?
1672000	1673000	No.
1673000	1678000	No. Okay.
1678000	1686000	But the big triangle is in the same place and at the same angle.
1686000	1689000	Same place and angle is what?
1689000	1691000	That's the one that you were looking at.
1691000	1711000	Okay.
1711000	1722000	Not at the same place and angle as the little triangle, but the big triangle to the right of that.
1722000	1728000	Oh, okay.
1728000	1736000	So is there like a rectangle sort of thing that's like on the left diagonal?
1736000	1756000	Yep.
1756000	1761000	You have two triangles on the left side sort of standing alone.
1762000	1770000	On the bottom right corner we have a trapezoid that's parallel with the large base at the bottom.
1770000	1782000	The highest shape is a square that looks like it's falling off of the frame to the left.
1782000	1786000	Wait, sorry, can you describe the square again?
1786000	1801000	It looks like it's falling off of a body from the left or it's like 10 to 15 degree angle tilted leftward at the top of the frame.
1801000	1814000	Slightly above a triangle at a similar angle bound by one more triangle.
1814000	1826000	Towards the bottom-ish left is there like a triangle that's like kind of detached?
1826000	1843000	Yeah.
1843000	1858000	A diamond at the top and then a triangle right below that leading into a rectangle or a body.
1858000	1870000	And then you have a little swish at the bottom right corner pointing to the right side.
1870000	1872000	Okay, what's the highest shape?
1872000	1874000	A diamond.
1874000	1883000	Diamond?
1883000	1885000	What was that?
1885000	1886000	What's up?
1886000	1889000	What's the highest shape?
1889000	1891000	A diamond.
1891000	1895000	Okay, okay, okay, one sec, diamond.
1895000	1897000	Okay, and it looks like a body?
1897000	1899000	Yep.
1899000	1906000	Okay, on two legs or one leg?
1906000	1915000	It kind of looks like a baby, it doesn't have any legs.
1915000	1924000	Like maybe we're wrapped up in a blanket with its head sticking out of the top and a portion of the blanket hanging off the right.
1924000	1928000	Hands sticking up?
1928000	1930000	Is there anything on the right side?
1930000	1935000	That's a triangle at the bottom of the grid.
1935000	1937000	A triangle in the bottom right?
1937000	1956000	Yep.
1956000	1960000	Is it like just the point facing the right?
1960000	1962000	Right flat.
1962000	1965000	Pointing up?
1965000	1967000	No.
1967000	1974000	So, okay, the point of the triangle, is it facing the right side?
1974000	1980000	Yeah.
1980000	2007000	Okay.
2007000	2016000	At the top of the grid, there is a very small triangle pointing left, connected to a larger triangle pointing bottom left.
2016000	2023000	In the mid portion, there's a diamond on the left side.
2023000	2030000	It looks like a big bunny is trying to read a book.
2030000	2031000	It looks like a bunny?
2031000	2032000	Yeah.
2032000	2038000	With a really big right triangle sort of in the bottom left?
2038000	2043000	No, it's not that bunny.
2043000	2055000	It looks like an anamorphic bunny standing up trying to read a book that it's holding to its left side.
2055000	2058000	Okay, a really small triangle on the top?
2058000	2075000	Yep.
2075000	2098000	Okay, this one looks like somebody is dancing with their head wailing back to the right, their feet pointing to the left, one leg lifted up in the air.
2098000	2106000	On what side are the feet facing the left?
2106000	2108000	Yeah.
2108000	2133000	Okay.
2133000	2140000	This one looks kind of like a submarine with a diamond on the top of it.
2140000	2149000	The highest point, yep.
2149000	2153000	Oh my god.
2153000	2180000	This one looks like somebody is standing at an altar, diamonds at the top forming a head into a rectangular body with a triangle at the midsection pointing left and a triangular base.
2180000	2189000	Okay, so the base, there's like, it's like a triangular base, it's not like flat on either side, okay.
2189000	2192000	Yep.
2192000	2208000	And then a small triangle on the right side about midway up.
2208000	2220000	This one looks kind of like a cactus or a totem pole or like a siren.
2220000	2240000	And it has two triangles facing inward so that they're large and facing outward on either side.
2240000	2250000	This one looks like another bar with a silo but the silo has a big triangular roof on it.
2250000	2267000	Or a weird like chimney that has a triangle on the left side.
2267000	2269000	Can you say that again?
2269000	2298000	A house or a bar with a tower on the left side and a triangle pointing up at the top of the tower.
2298000	2308000	The diamond bottom lapse kind of looks like a, I don't know, like a gun that's drawn looking.
2308000	2331000	There's a trapezoid at the top with the short sides pointing down, the handle on the left sides.
2331000	2333000	Okay, you said diamond bottom lapse?
2333000	2336000	Yep.
2336000	2339000	What's the highest shape?
2339000	2348000	A trapezoid with the larger base pointing up, facing up.
2348000	2356000	It looks like it's pointing to the right.
2356000	2359000	How big is the diamond?
2359000	2363000	It's small.
2363000	2376000	I feel like the only one I've seen of that has a small triangle at the top.
2376000	2383000	Go for it.
2383000	2388000	Oh, wait, okay.
2389000	2403000	Is it like the bottom side and the right side don't really have anything touching them that much?
2403000	2406000	It looks like an upside down L.
2406000	2425000	Okay, yeah.
2425000	2445000	Somebody slumps down with their back in the right corner, a foot pointing left of the left corner, and a diamond head.
2445000	2447000	You said diamond at the top?
2447000	2456000	Yep.
2456000	2458000	And they're facing the left corner?
2458000	2459000	Yep.
2459000	2461000	Are they sitting down?
2461000	2477000	Yep.
2477000	2482000	With somebody standing up reading a book, the book is pointing to the left.
2482000	2492000	It guides a triangle to make the foot pointing to the left, and a diamond forming the head.
2492000	2494000	So they're reading a book?
2494000	2514000	Yep.
2514000	2521000	At the bottom, is it like on the right it's like smooth, but on the left it's like a point?
2521000	2538000	Yep.
2538000	2558000	This one looks like a figure skater with their back leg pointing to the right side, both arms pointing to the left side, diamond head in the left corner.
2558000	2581000	Somebody kneeling down to pray, we've got a diamond at the top, and at the bottom we have a smooth side of the rectangle on the left side with a triangle pointing to the right.
2581000	2586000	Did they have like a rectangular neck?
2586000	2588000	Um, diamond head.
2588000	2593000	Like diamond head, but is there a neck, or is it just like a point?
2593000	2595000	Um, it's just a point.
2595000	2601000	Okay.
2601000	2603000	You said they're praying?
2603000	2612000	It kind of looks like the reading of a book one, but in reverse, and with a pivot in the left side.
2612000	2619000	I did not get any of that.
2619000	2621000	What's the highest shape?
2621000	2630000	Diamond.
2630000	2634000	And what's the lowest shape?
2634000	2658000	Um, a couple of triangles, a big one pointing left, and a small one pointing right, or a big one pointing bottom left corner, making a smooth edge, or parallel edges on the left side and the bottom side, and then a small triangle pointing to the right.
2658000	2687000	The head is attached to another diamond, so it kind of looks like an infinity sign leading into the body.
2687000	2690000	I can't, can you say that again?
2690000	2699000	The head is attached to another diamond, so it kind of looks like an infinity sign leading into the body.
2699000	2701000	A what sign?
2701000	2703000	Infinity.
2703000	2709000	Oh, infinity, okay.
2709000	2712000	Or an eight, by the way.
2712000	2732000	Infinity pointing to the left.
2732000	2743000	Oriented like an eight.
2743000	2746000	Is there like body facing an obvious way?
2746000	2748000	To the right.
2748000	2760000	Okay, diamond, but no neck, body facing right, infinity sign on the left.
2760000	2764000	I don't think I'm really getting the infinity sign part.
2764000	2771000	Okay, lose the infinity sign.
2771000	2776000	What's going on in the middle of the left side?
2776000	2779000	A rhombus was taken out.
2779000	2783000	Damn it, okay, it's fine.
2783000	2798000	It's fine.
2798000	2800000	Looks like somebody's reading a book.
2800000	2804000	They're in a slight crouch, facing right.
2804000	2806000	Okay.
2806000	2808000	Oh, but they're facing the right?
2808000	2814000	Okay, highest shape.
2814000	2817000	Repeat that.
2817000	2819000	What's the highest shape?
2819000	2821000	Diamond.
2821000	2824000	Okay, is there a neck, or is it just a point?
2824000	2829000	There's kind of a neck.
2829000	2835000	Is there a right triangle in the bottom left?
2835000	2837000	Yeah.
2837000	2859000	Okay.
2859000	2865000	This one looks like an arrowhead pointing down, or a flask.
2865000	2871000	It's got two diamonds, and then a rectangular at the top, or a square at the top.
2871000	2873000	Where are the two diamonds?
2873000	2877000	Sitting on top of each other.
2877000	2899000	So it looks like an eight with a square at the top.
2899000	2904000	A person with a diamond head at the top, no neck.
2904000	2908000	The left side is very flat.
2908000	2917000	The bottom most shape is a triangle pointing down on the right side.
2917000	2921000	Looks like a leg is cleared out to the right.
2921000	2925000	A triangle pointing down at the right side?
2925000	2927000	Yep.
2927000	2933000	Does it look like they have a foot that's facing the wrong way?
2933000	2951000	Yeah.
2951000	2960000	This one looks like a bunny slumped out in a corner with his butt to the left.
2960000	2963000	Bunny looking down.
2963000	2967000	Is the bunny's head looking to the right bottom?
2967000	2980000	Yep.
2980000	2993000	This one looks like it wants to be a duck on the water.
2993000	3001000	There's a tiny triangle in the bottom left corner connected to a bigger triangle.
3002000	3010000	The tiny triangle in the bottom left has its right angle pointing to the top left corner,
3010000	3015000	while the big triangle has its right angle pointing to the top right corner,
3015000	3023000	and then at the top there's another triangle on the right side with its right angle pointing to the top right.
3023000	3027000	Is the triangle the tallest shape?
3027000	3029000	Or the highest shape?
3029000	3031000	The third one, yeah.
3031000	3034000	Barely?
3034000	3040000	Yes, it's the highest shape.
3040000	3044000	And you said there's a small triangle in the bottom left?
3044000	3053000	Yep.
3053000	3055000	Kind of like a swan?
3055000	3077000	Yep.
3077000	3089000	This person is standing with their legs spread apart, one foot pointing to the left, diamond head, no neck, really thin waist.
3089000	3092000	Do they have like a thin torso?
3092000	3108000	Yeah.
3108000	3116000	Diamond at the top connected by a point to a large triangle.
3116000	3121000	On the left we have a triangle pointing down about midway through,
3121000	3127000	and then on the bottom left we have a very small triangle pointing to the left.
3127000	3137000	The bottom has a triangle cut out of its...
3137000	3142000	You said at the bottom left there's a small triangle with the point facing to the left?
3142000	3146000	Yep.
3146000	3149000	Is it like in the bottom left corner or...?
3149000	3152000	Yep.
3152000	3165000	Okay.
3165000	3169000	What's going on on the right side of the spur?
3169000	3174000	Nothing.
3174000	3194000	Interesting.
3194000	3201000	Okay, and can you describe it from bottom up?
3201000	3210000	We have in the bottom left a small triangle pointing left to the bottom left,
3210000	3219000	and then a triangular cut out acting as a space between a small triangle and a very large triangle that forms the body.
3219000	3229000	A very large triangle points to the right side about halfway up the frame.
3229000	3235000	On the left middle portion there is another triangle pointing directly down,
3235000	3257000	and at the top there is a diamond.
3257000	3274000	It's very difficult to hear him.
3274000	3276000	Explosion.
