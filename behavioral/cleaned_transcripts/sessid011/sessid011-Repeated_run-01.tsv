0	2000	You
30000	32000	You
37800	39800	All right
40000	42500	So in the bottom left
43320	47360	There is a triangle. It's an equilateral triangle
48120	52120	The point of it is like in the point of the square
53160	54920	so like
54920	56920	the
56960	58960	Like
59400	63240	Okay, yeah, so the point of the triangle is like in the plane of square I
65120	67120	Guess it's actually a right triangle
69040	75480	Because one side is parallel to the top of the square the other side is parallel to like
76120	78120	the sides of the square
82160	84160	And then
85160	90680	In addition there is a like rectangular shape
91720	93720	that is
94040	96040	Along the left diagonal
114160	126320	Okay, this is like a small square on top of like the figure eight thing
127720	129720	like arrowhead
130440	132440	You
143040	147120	Okay, this looks like a thin tall rectangle in the middle
152400	157240	Technically not a rectangle because at the top it's like yeah
160600	162600	You
170760	173680	Okay, this is the one that kind of just looks like a hot mess
175760	178720	There's like four triangles a square
180440	182440	Rhombus
190640	192640	You
195360	199200	To me this looks like an angel looking towards the bottom left
202760	204760	Squarehead
205600	207600	Rhombus arms
209440	211440	Rhombus body
220720	222720	You
228840	236280	Okay, someone is sitting down with their back and facing the right so yeah
250720	254760	All righty, this looks like a small square in the bottom left
256240	260040	But the main portion of it kind of looks like a swan
266320	269640	The small square that's in the bottom left is touching
270280	272280	at a point like
272400	275440	the base of a triangle a
276240	278240	right triangle
280720	282240	And
282240	288480	Then that triangle is attached to well, I guess another triangle. That's a right triangle
289280	291280	in like the middle and
291400	293400	then there's
295440	300920	Rhombus sort of and like and then like a rectangle in the upper right and
301920	304520	Then a right triangle the upper ish, right?
309720	311720	If
313240	319800	You're asking questions, I can't hear you. Okay. Okay. That's fine
325960	327960	How can I describe this
327960	329960	I
335920	339080	This is like the only one that
340480	342680	Has a like distinct
344160	350640	Very small triangle that is touching but not really part of the bigger picture
357960	359960	You
367320	369320	All right
371000	373000	From top down
373440	375600	there is a diamond and
376720	380040	then a short thin neck and
381080	382640	then a
382640	385880	Triangle that is facing like up
386880	389920	Towards the middle ish a decent-sized one
391280	396400	To the left of that triangle is a small triangle
409640	412160	Okay, this is like a body
413160	419000	I'm sort of like a one-year rabbit. I guess it's yeah
435040	440080	And this looks animalistic facing the left
442640	446480	Sort of like a pony with a tail
451360	453360	Say that again
465800	469280	Yeah, okay the legs are not on the same level
472640	474640	I
482600	485920	Okay, this kind of looks like a
488520	493600	Right triangle that has a head and bunny ears
496840	498840	Facing the right
503160	505160	I
513600	519960	Okay, this looks like a human who is dancing
522240	529600	With one leg on the floor and the other leg not clearly visible. They are wearing like a skirt
530600	535280	And they have like their arms facing the right
549040	554840	This kind of looks like someone is kneeling down but
555200	562520	Like not just like bending down like their entire like all of their shins are actually on the floor
574520	576520	All righty
576560	578800	This person has very distinct feet
579040	584080	They're both facing the left one of them is in the air one of them is flat on the floor
596800	599840	Like upside down L pretty much
609160	611160	I
616360	618920	Okay, this is kind of like
620280	625120	Previous one like the kneeling down, but their shins are like not on the floor
626120	628120	I
634040	636040	I
638840	641120	This is like the house with the chimney
645760	647760	Like barn door
656120	658120	I
661120	663040	Okay
663040	665040	This one is like
665640	667640	animalistic, but just barely
669160	672600	Like it looks like it has like four legs on the ground sort of
674560	676560	Facing the left
685120	687120	You
709120	711120	Okay
715120	718120	My back is killing me
