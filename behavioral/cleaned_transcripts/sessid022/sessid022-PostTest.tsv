0	3000	Okay, cool.
22000	25000	Ah, this is a simple guide, nearly.
30000	42000	Um, this is a new person who's peeking out to the, their feet to the bottom right.
42000	47000	They kind of look like they, uh, have a, yep, yep.
47000	59000	Um, this is the one that looks like a cliff with a diamond on top.
59000	77000	Um, this is the person I said when they were rolling a martini glass.
77000	82000	They got a diamond head. They got their hands out, let's say, to the left.
82000	87000	And they have this kind of upwards facing triangle.
87000	98000	Oh. Oh, sorry about that. Oh, I see what you mean now.
98000	114000	Um, this is the one I said looked like a swan. It's just kind of a two rectangles and a little diamond, yeah.
114000	132000	Uh, this is the, uh, this is the rabbit sitting, looking right at the triangle body.
132000	149000	Uh, this is a crab. It's a crab that's looking at the top right.
149000	154000	Uh, this is the person out there. He is holding the bullet to the right.
154000	167000	Oh, he's kneeling? Kneeling, yeah.
167000	186000	Uh, this is a weird rabbit person. They're, like, out behind them with a square out there.
186000	196000	Anyone, this is, uh, it's really weird. It's, like, too symmetrical, too, like, symmetric.
196000	204000	Is it the bull shape thing? No, they're, like, robbuses. Honestly, it kind of looks like a bra.
204000	215000	Oh, I see.
215000	232000	Uh, this is the hexagon water cat that's flat, that's short, with a diamond on top.
232000	248000	This is the guy with no arms, just doing the splits.
248000	255000	Uh, this is the cape guy. He's facing right at his capes to the top left.
255000	260000	Uh, sorry, could you repeat that? The cape guy. The guy with the cape.
260000	264000	Oh. He's facing, yeah. Yeah, sorry, I didn't hear you.
264000	271000	Oh, okay.
271000	292000	Uh, this is, like, the guy who's looking down and running a horse, facing left.
292000	308000	I said they were figure skaters. They look like they're going to the left. They're kicking their legs out behind them.
308000	317000	Oh, this is the one you said looked like a mouse. Looks like they're on one knee with their leg behind them, sticking their arms out either way.
317000	322000	They've got a diamond head.
322000	329000	Oh, yeah.
329000	345000	This is the person who's sitting facing leftwards. They kind of got their feet out. Maybe they're reading a book. They're looking down. Yeah.
345000	366000	Oh, this is a weird one. This is, uh, smells like someone lounging on one arm, and they've got a weird kind of square head at the top left, and more of like a parallelogram to the top right. It's a weird one, though.
366000	371000	So the bottom, it looks like they're kind of lounging on one arm.
371000	376000	Is that arm, like, really large, and it's, like, almost being dragged on the left?
376000	384000	It's, the arm's on the right. It's more of a, it's just a triangle.
384000	395000	It's kind of this, like, kind of, yeah, it's kind of a, uh, it's like a parallelogram.
395000	406000	This is the bottom, and then the thing sticking out to the bottom right is, like, a triangle.
406000	411000	I mean, I'm seeing someone lounging with, yeah.
411000	416000	Yeah, I guess it's not really much of a head, but I see them lounging.
416000	433000	This is the tall water fountain with the diamond on top.
433000	450000	Yeah, this is the person that's half-crouched facing right, holding out, uh, yeah.
450000	464000	This is the tiny parallelogram guy off a dog.
464000	469000	This one, though, when I see it, it looks like a sheep, like, or a scythe, rather.
469000	475000	It looks kind of like, um, something used to cut, um, wheat.
475000	478000	And so it's got this kind of tall, yeah, right?
478000	482000	It looks almost also like, uh, like a bottle opener.
482000	487000	Yeah, no, oh yeah, totally, yeah.
487000	502000	This is the dog that's crouching and facing left.
502000	513000	This is, um, so, uh, it's, they've got this very skinny little head, and they look like they're looking down.
513000	517000	They're kind of holding a book, they're facing left and looking down.
517000	527000	But they're, they really, they have this really skinny triangle head that's kind of going up into the top left.
527000	533000	Yeah, I almost want to mess their hair.
533000	554000	Um, this is, uh, the, like, tall straight guy facing left.
554000	564000	This one looks like barbed wire, where it's just, like, really tall, and it's got kind of pointy, pointy issues, yeah.
564000	568000	Oh no.
568000	573000	Uh, this is the house with, uh, a really tall chimney on the right.
573000	577000	Ah, okay.
577000	580000	For a second, my screen went out.
580000	581000	Uh-oh.
581000	582000	Yeah.
582000	584000	I think it's back down now.
584000	585000	Fingers crossed.
585000	586000	Yeah.
586000	603000	This is the bird flying to the right.
603000	605000	This one kind of looks like a weird crab.
605000	609000	It's kind of like a crab going up where it's, where it's gone.
609000	610000	Oh no.
610000	611000	Sorry.
611000	612000	Yeah.
612000	613000	I clicked too quickly.
613000	619000	No, that one's also a crab.
619000	621000	This one looks like a spear.
621000	636000	It's like two diamonds and then a little, like, square on top.
636000	652000	This is the horse galloping to the left.
652000	655000	This is the guy, so it looks like a frog.
655000	656000	I don't know.
656000	658000	He's got two tiny little triangle feet.
658000	660000	Maybe he's got a bit of a top hat.
660000	664000	He's got an arm sticking out to the right.
665000	667000	I see it.
667000	671000	Maybe it's because the triangles make it look like the feet are, like, webbed.
671000	673000	I thought this was, like, a turtle.
673000	675000	I mean, it's kind of like a parallelogram.
675000	677000	It's going to the top left.
677000	679000	It's got, like, a little diamond head.
679000	681000	It's got a little parallelogram.
681000	682000	Oh, yes.
682000	694000	It's got long diamond arms.
694000	707000	This is the house with the palm tree on the left.
707000	722000	This is the martial arts fighter.
722000	726000	This is the one that you thought was a crab.
726000	728000	It also looks like a crab.
728000	732000	I mean, it's just kind of very, kind of like a rhombus on the bottom.
732000	734000	A symmetrical one?
734000	739000	Oh, this is better.
739000	746000	Yeah, it looks like a crab, too.
746000	748000	Nice. Good job.
748000	760000	Yay. You have a swap.
760000	771000	Okay.
771000	773000	Okay.
