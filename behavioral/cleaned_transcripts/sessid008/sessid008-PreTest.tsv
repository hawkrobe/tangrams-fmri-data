0	16060	Nope.
16060	42660	Yeah, it sounds good.
47060	71060	So, um, it's a picture of, um, it's like a woman, um, who has, like, one leg outside.
71060	80060	Um, that one leg is pointed, like, downwards, um, 45 degrees towards, um, the bottom right of the square.
80060	94060	Um, there's a triangle on top, it's, um, sorry, there's a diamond on top, which is, like, the head, and it's, it's, like, standing on this woman.
94060	97060	Like, it's standing on, like, one corner.
97060	102060	Um, uh, no, uh, it's another one, it's not that.
110060	117060	Okay, this time it's, like, someone, um, riding an animal, maybe it's, like, a dog, maybe it's a horse.
117060	121060	Or, really, you could say it's a dog riding another dog.
121060	126060	Um, you can also speak, so you can ask me before you.
126060	127060	Oh, okay.
131060	134060	Does it look like there's, uh...
134060	137060	It looks like two things riding on each other.
138060	145060	Okay, is there, like, um, like a small triangle at the end that looks like a tail?
145060	147060	Yes, yes, you're right.
147060	149060	Okay.
152060	154060	Perfect, yeah.
156060	169060	So, it's, uh, okay, I'm not sure if you remember what you selected for the first time, but, uh, that's what it is now.
169060	170060	Oh, okay.
170060	175060	It's that triangle thing, but it's exactly what you selected the first time around.
175060	177060	Alright.
179060	181060	Perfect.
186060	193060	Okay, this looks like, it's the closest thing there is to a tree there, it looks like a piece of cactus.
193060	198060	Um, there are very sharp edges, like, something like axes on both sides.
201060	204060	It looks like a piece of cactus.
206060	209060	Is it, like, it's, like, flat on the side, though?
209060	216060	It is, uh, it is flat on these sides, um, it's like there are two, uh, triangles which are somewhat cut on these sides.
216060	218060	Okay.
220060	222060	Perfect.
228060	231060	Oh my god, okay, this is complicated, right?
231060	236060	Um, think about the square as representing the head of, like, someone, right?
236060	241060	This is a picture, um, okay, this is going to be hard, right?
241060	255060	But, suppose, like, the tail part of it, right, is at the top, so it's weird, and the head is at the bottom, the head is, like, square, um, I think there's only one picture in which the square is at the, like, bottom.
256060	258060	Okay.
258060	266060	And is there, like, a small triangle at the top?
266060	269060	Yes, exactly, you're right.
269060	293060	Okay, this looks like a swan, basically, like, uh, there's a rectangle, and on the left-hand side of the rectangle, you have, like, um, well, the swan's head coming up.
293060	295060	Can you repeat that?
295060	300060	Well, uh, so this picture, like, is very basic, it looks like a swan.
300060	301060	Like a what?
301060	303060	A swan, like a...
303060	305060	Oh, a swan?
305060	311060	Yeah, or like a goose, or like any, like, water-based animal, with a long neck.
311060	314060	Oh, a sloth, like the animal, oh, okay.
314060	317060	Um, like a goose.
317060	321060	Oh, wait, I actually pressed the wrong button.
321060	323060	Oh, yeah, no worries.
323060	340060	Okay, so this looks like, um, with the square on top there being a head, it looks like someone, um, who's leaning against the wall, but they're seated, and their legs are in front of them.
340060	342060	You can describe the picture as well.
342060	345060	Their legs are in front of them.
345060	347060	Yeah, the legs are in front of them.
347060	349060	Which way, which way are the legs pointing?
349060	352060	The leg, uh, is pointing towards the left.
352060	353060	Okay.
353060	356060	And they're, like, sitting down, almost?
356060	361060	Yeah, they're almost sitting down with their backs leaned against the wall, and their head is slightly...
361060	362060	Slucking down?
362060	363060	Yeah, yeah.
363060	364060	Alright.
364060	390060	Okay, this last, uh, this one, okay, um, it has that, uh, diamond head resting on the top, but, um, the body is slightly weird.
390060	400060	So the body consists of, on the left-hand side, it's a straight line, it's like a square, and on the right-hand side, um, they're, like, this person is really fat.
400060	410060	Um, it's, it's as if they were, it's as if they were facing to their right, and to the left, it's just their back, it's one straight line.
410060	424060	To their right, um, you can see their hands raised forwards, and you can see their, like, yes, exactly.
424060	431060	Okay, this last thing is, um, well, there are two legs pointed towards the top, um, and the head is towards the bottom.
431060	437060	It's as if they're trying to, like, I don't know, stand on both of their hands.
437060	440060	Is there a square for the head at the bottom?
440060	442060	Yes, there's a square for the head, yes.
442060	445060	And is it, it's on top of a triangle?
445060	447060	Uh, yes, you're right, yes.
447060	451060	And there's, there's, like, two small triangles as the legs are?
451060	464060	Exactly, yep, yep, you're right.
464060	473060	Okay, this next thing, um, uh, okay, this next thing does not have a diamond for its head, it just has a triangle for its head.
473060	478060	Like, I'm not sure if you know the Batman logo, it's something like that for the...
478060	479060	The what logo?
479060	480060	Batman.
480060	481060	Oh, Batman?
481060	493060	Um, it, it looks, and it, like, it has a tail that's, um, towards the right-hand side of the box, specifically the bottom right corner of the box.
493060	496060	Uh, okay, and there's, like, there's, like, three spikes at the top?
496060	508060	Exactly, yes, yes, yep.
508060	516060	Okay, this next thing, um, also looks like a swan, but the swan is slightly different, right? There are a few things which look like a swan there.
516060	528060	Um, it has two legs, and one leg is, uh, like, both legs are actually triangles, but one leg is a small, um, like, triangle towards the left-hand side.
528060	534060	And this swan's head is, like, pointing below. Maybe it could be a duck.
534060	546060	Okay.
546060	558060	Okay, this last thing is, is like a hexagon, right? Um, but with a triangle cut out of it.
558060	568060	So, so this thing should technically have six sides, but it has a triangle cut out from it.
568060	570060	Okay, um.
570060	572060	It has an opening on the top.
572060	575060	All right.
575060	584060	That's where the triangle, yes, right.
584060	610060	Okay, this next thing is, um, is, it looks like a fruit, right? It looks like a fruit with two diamonds stacked on top of each other, and maybe a stem on top of the fruit.
610060	626060	So this next thing is a person. The person's head is a diamond. They're opening, uh, out their hands. It's outstretched. There are no legs, and it's as if they're, like, just spreading their arms wide.
626060	630060	All right, does it look like they're kneeling or, like, leaning diagonally to the left?
630060	632060	Yes, you're right.
632060	634060	Which, which one?
634060	638060	They're leaning diagonally, uh, to the left.
638060	640060	Oh, oh my gosh, sorry.
640060	641060	No worries.
641060	645060	I keep, like, pressing the wrong way.
645060	649060	Okay.
649060	663060	Okay, this next picture, uh, has a diamond for its head. It's kneeling on the floor with its legs, uh, apparent behind, and this person's hands are, like, outstretched, almost like a prayer position.
663060	678060	Um, and this woman is, uh, like, facing to the right, um, and, yeah, kneeling, and her legs are facing to the left. It's a diamond head on the top, and the legs are a triangle, like, facing upward.
678060	680060	She's facing the left?
680060	681060	She's facing the right.
681060	682060	The right.
682060	686060	Her legs are, like, facing the left.
686060	697060	She's kneeling.
697060	714060	Okay, this next thing looks like an animal, I guess, but it's got some weird balancing. The whole thing, the whole picture, you can consider it to be, like, diagonal. It's standing on its two feet, right, but it's, like, um, lifting up its body in such a way that it's so weird, right?
715060	717060	Is it, like, making a diagonal?
717060	732060	It is. The whole thing is making a diagonal. It looks very unstable. I don't know how the animal is gonna be up. You're right.
732060	755060	Okay, this next thing has a diamond for its head, and has a, uh, triangle for its tail. Um, maybe it's, like, a dog, and it's standing with its two feet in front. It's standing, like, high on those two feet, like, two feet in the front, and it's facing to the right-hand side of the box, and it's sort of, like, resting on its, like, two feet behind. Yep.
762060	768060	So this thing is, like, a house with a tree beside it. It has a door.
768060	770060	The tree's on the left?
770060	771060	Yes.
771060	795060	So this thing looks like a rabbit. It has, um, two ears on top, and it is leaning, uh, it's leaning towards the left, but it's facing to the right. Yes.
801060	822060	So this picture is of a person they're wearing. It's more accurate to say it's a hat than it's a head. It's the only thing there that looks like a hat. They have two triangle feet, and they have one arm outstretched to the right.
822060	837060	You can ask me. Yeah, okay, cool.
837060	860060	So this person has a diamond head with one hand somewhat reaching towards the top, and maybe they're wearing a gown or something, but there's one feet just outside facing the right, and this other, like, their dress or their other feet is pointing backwards towards the left. They're basically on their knees.
861060	867060	Does it look like they're praying? Almost like their hands are out to the right?
867060	869060	Yeah, yeah, you could say that.
869060	870060	Oh.
870060	881060	Okay, my bad, my bad, my bad. That one looked more like praying.
881060	905060	Okay, this person's square head is, like, facing towards the right. Like, it's facing backwards, really, but they're trying to walk to the left. You can see both of their feet, like, gesturing as if they're walking, and their hands are also in front on the left, but their head is facing backwards.
905060	908060	Their head is just a diamond?
908060	916060	It's a diamond, but it's more, like, in a squarish position.
916060	919060	Oh, okay.
919060	926060	Is there, like, a, like a, I don't know, a beak, like, facing downward towards the left?
926060	940060	Yes, you're right.
940060	968060	Okay, this is a diamond head on the top. It's resting on, so imagine this person's back is towards their left, so it's square, it's a straight line on that side, but towards the right is a triangle, and they've got their heads, sorry, they've got their legs outstretched to the right, and at the same time it looks like they have another leg towards their left, and they're kneeling on it.
968060	971060	This is complicated, so ask me questions.
971060	977060	So is there, like, a triangle sticking out towards the right at the top, underneath the head?
977060	990060	Yes, you're right.
990060	1003060	Okay, this thing looks like an animal. I want to say that it looks like a dog with its head, yeah, it literally looks like a dog, like a dog with a very long body.
1003060	1004060	No tail?
1004060	1007060	No tail.
1007060	1017060	It does not have a tail, though.
1017060	1033060	This next thing looks like a swan, but it's upside down, like, so it's, like, at the top part of it, the right, the top right-hand corner of it is, like, a triangle. Like, yeah.
1033060	1037060	Does it look like a blow dryer?
1037060	1051060	Yeah, yeah, I would say so, yes.
1051060	1061060	So this next thing has a diamond on top of its head, it's resting on a square person, and it's as if they're giving a speech at a podium.
1061060	1065060	Is it flat on the left side?
1065060	1070060	Yes, it's flat on the left side, on the right side there's a mini-triangle.
1070060	1078060	Oh, but no, wait, wait, wait, there are two things which look similar. The podium is a lot shorter than them. It's not, like, together with-
1078060	1081060	Oh, okay, okay. Let's see.
1081060	1084060	And is there, like, a small triangle sticking out on the right?
1084060	1099060	Yes, that is the one.
1099060	1115060	So this next thing looks like a graduate, like, wearing their gowns with their hands outstretched in the left direction, and they're clearly wearing a gown because, like, you know, their hands are, like, disproportionate in space.
1115060	1125060	They're facing to the left, yes.
1125060	1140060	Okay, this picture is hard, but it looks like there's a diamond head on the top, but the body of it, think of it, it looks like a pepper or something like that.
1140060	1142060	Is it, like, banana shaped?
1142060	1156060	Yes, it's something like that, yes.
1156060	1171060	Okay, this next thing looks like a dog with a person riding it. Like, it might be a dog, might be a horse, but there's another thing riding it.
1171060	1174060	There's, like, a square and a triangle on top of the dog.
1174060	1187060	Yeah, yeah, you're right.
1187060	1207060	This next person has a diamond head resting on a triangle, like, upper body, and they seem to be running, they're running in the left direction, they're facing the left, but it seems like they're running for something with their hands outstretched in front of them.
1207060	1211060	Is one leg pointed to the left, and it looks like there's a foot?
1211060	1226060	Yeah.
1226060	1247060	This other picture is a picture, it looks like a woman with hair, her hair is behind her, she's facing to the left, her hair is on the right, it's a diamond, and she's kneeling, no, she's not really kneeling, she's sitting, like, sitting with her legs in front of her and her hands outstretched in front of her.
1247060	1255060	You could say that she looks like she's praying, but there are a few other pictures that look like that, so ask me anything.
1255060	1257060	Does she have a square head?
1257060	1260060	Yes, she has a square head.
1260060	1267060	Is there a right triangle on the right side, pointing to the right?
1267060	1276060	Yeah, that's basically her hair, but no, it's not her hat, it's her hair.
1276060	1284060	Is her body just like a rectangle, like it's straight?
1284060	1294060	No, her body is not a rectangle, but you need to see her feet in front of her.
1294060	1308060	Her foot is in front of her, her square head is resting on a triangle body, and the most distinctive thing about her, this is something only she had, right? She has a triangle right behind her square head.
1308060	1310060	She has a what?
1310060	1320060	She has a triangle right behind her square head.
1320060	1323060	Ask me.
1323060	1332060	Is there like a thicker leg on the left side and a small triangle on the right attached to it?
1332060	1344060	No, the only legs that appear are on the left side.
1344060	1348060	Is it flat on the left?
1348060	1355060	What flat on the left?
1355060	1366060	So I'm looking at like, it's like kind of thicker at the bottom on the left side compared to the right side, and it's like horizontal?
1366060	1370060	No, it's not thicker on the left side than the right side.
1370060	1379060	Okay, the one thing I need you to look for, square head triangle like hair right behind it. Like if you can see that, that is the only picture.
1379060	1383060	Square and triangle right behind it.
1383060	1387060	Square head triangle right beside, like to the right of it.
1387060	1392060	Oh, okay. Let's see. And there's like an arm sticking out on the right.
1392060	1394060	Yes, yes, right.
1394060	1397060	Oh, interesting.
1397060	1404060	Okay.
1404060	1409060	Okay, this looks like a submarine with a diamond on top of it.
1409060	1422060	Alright.
1422060	1427060	Okay, this looks like a house with a chimney beside it.
1427060	1428060	On the right?
1428060	1444060	Yes.
1444060	1453060	So this looks like an animal that is maybe like a horse or something like that, that has triangle feet, triangle head, has a tail.
1453060	1457060	The tail is pointing towards the right. The face is pointing towards the left.
1457060	1470060	This animal is like almost balancing in one leg. The legs are not on the same level. Right.
1470060	1481060	So this next thing almost looks like a, one could say it looks like a seesaw, one could say it looks like a phone, like an old phone, like you would need to pick it up.
1481060	1485060	Is there like a place where a square could fit into it?
1485060	1497060	Yes, you're right.
1497060	1512060	Okay, this one is actually the picture of that like person praying, like not kneeling, but like genuflecting, like bending their knees a little bit with their arms pointed out, like open to the right.
1512060	1517060	It's almost like an S shape.
1517060	1518060	S, hold on.
1518060	1520060	Like the letter.
1520060	1521060	Hold on.
1521060	1524060	Is this like the knees are sticking out to the right?
1524060	1525060	Yes.
1551060	1556060	Doing good.
