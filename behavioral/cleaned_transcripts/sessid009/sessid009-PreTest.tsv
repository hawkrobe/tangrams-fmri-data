122000	128000	So he's facing towards the left and one of his legs, his right leg is stuck out really
128000	130000	long and his left one is like...

144000	146000	And his legs are off the ground?
147000	149000	Are his back legs on the ground-ish?
149000	153000	Everything's off the ground and his legs are like pointed for some reason, like his legs
153000	154000	are pointed.
155000	156000	I'm sorry.
156000	158000	And he has a weird hat.

185000	186000	All the dogs are facing left.
186000	187000	There's still that many dogs.
189000	192000	Okay, this dog has got a pointy head.
192000	193000	It's jumping in the air.
193000	194000	Its legs are straight down.
194000	198000	Its legs are two triangles, the same size and the same kind of shape as its head.
198000	200000	Its tail is a long rectangle.
200000	203000	I think I'm going to get this one wrong, but I'm going, I'm going.
203000	204000	And it's like really skinny.
204000	207000	Its stomach is like met in.
209000	210000	Let's go!
210000	213000	Okay, so I'm moving so much.
213000	214000	You have to be normal.
214000	215000	Okay.
216000	219000	This just looks like a boomerang if you do it in the air.
222000	224000	Does it look like a gun also?
224000	225000	Yes.
225000	226000	Okay, you could have said that.
226000	227000	Violent?

242000	243000	Nope, nope.
243000	244000	Okay, show us.
244000	245000	So this guy looks like...
246000	250000	Okay, you know how in the thriller they do this zombie dance?
252000	253000	Oh my god.
253000	254000	What the fuck did you just do?
255000	256000	I chose...
257000	259000	Hey, now this thing's out.
259000	261000	I was like scrolling and I accidentally hit it.
261000	262000	Don't be stupid.
262000	263000	Oh my god.
263000	264000	This looks like Yoda.
264000	265000	He's like tiny kid.
265000	267000	His hands are out, he's facing the left.
267000	268000	It looks like Yoda.
268000	269000	Wearing a rope.
270000	271000	Does it look like a pope?
271000	272000	Yes.
273000	274000	Yeah, I killed that.
275000	277000	I got one wrong, but now this thing's out.
277000	278000	I was excited to describe that one.
278000	279000	I think we're dumb.
279000	280000	Yeah, oh my god.
280000	281000	I'm so sorry.
281000	282000	Yeah.
283000	284000	That was a mistake though.
284000	288000	Is this just like a pole with two things sticking out on either side?
288000	289000	Oh yeah, I know, I know.
289000	290000	Yeah, okay.
290000	291000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
291000	292000	No, no, no.
292000	293000	Say it again.
293000	296000	A pole with two things sticking out on either side.
296000	297000	They look like speakers.
297000	298000	Oh my god, I know.
298000	299000	You stupid...
299000	301000	Okay, this is confusing me.
301000	302000	I'm not dumb.
302000	304000	Ben, maybe stop clicking things until you know the answer.
304000	306000	I know what she's saying.
306000	308000	Okay, my brain's gonna show that I know the answer.
308000	313000	This is a house with a tree that's on the left and the tree is bigger than the house.
313000	315000	Yeah, this is so easy.
315000	317000	I'm going, I'm going.
317000	319000	Wow, I'm surprised you didn't get that wrong.
319000	322000	Okay, honestly, shut the fuck up.
325000	326000	Okay.
329000	330000	Okay, go.
330000	331000	Yes.
333000	335000	Um, this looks like...
336000	339000	Um, it's kind of just like a dog with no legs.
339000	341000	Only hind legs, no front legs.
343000	347000	It's like a dog jumping and his back legs are still on the floor.
347000	348000	Yeah.
348000	349000	Okay.
349000	351000	You don't have to describe it.
352000	355000	Honestly, I'm not even gonna say it.
355000	356000	Okay, don't.
356000	357000	But you know.
358000	360000	It's gonna make me move, so okay.
360000	362000	This is like, um...
363000	365000	I don't think I know how to, okay.
366000	367000	Well, you have to.
367000	368000	I'm trying.
368000	370000	So it's like, um...
370000	372000	It's kind of like a dustpan.
372000	378000	Like the thing that you put on the ground and you sweep dust into with the mop.
378000	380000	Oh, I know what that is.
380000	382000	Do you see what I'm talking about though?
382000	383000	No, I don't.
383000	385000	It's like, um...
385000	391000	If you were holding it and put it, it's kind of just like, it has like a handle and then it has like a long flat part and two side things.
393000	396000	It's facing the right.
399000	402000	Or it kind of looks like, um...
402000	412000	Look, you know those short hairbrushes that have like handles in the back and they're kind of like, it's like a skinny rectangle connected to like a long fat rectangle?
412000	414000	You're sucking.
414000	415000	What's wrong with you?
415000	416000	Be better.
416000	417000	This one is hard.
417000	418000	Um...
418000	420000	Or like, okay.
420000	422000	It's definitely not one of the people, right?
422000	424000	No, it doesn't look like a person at all.
424000	426000	So that should rule some out.
426000	427000	Okay.
427000	428000	Think of a dustpan.
428000	430000	Which one looks the most like a dustpan?
430000	431000	I'm talking.
431000	432000	Um...
432000	435000	It's not the claw facing up, right?
435000	436000	No.
436000	438000	Okay.
438000	439000	This is...
439000	441000	If it's this, you're stupid.
441000	443000	This is not a dustpan.
443000	444000	What is that then?
444000	445000	Sophia.
445000	446000	Don't be mean to me.
446000	447000	I'm trying my hardest.
447000	448000	I'm trying my hardest.
448000	449000	Dustpan on this shit?
449000	450000	What is it?
450000	451000	What is it then?
451000	453000	Well, something else.
453000	455000	Okay, this guy's doing handstands, that's it.
455000	457000	Um...
459000	461000	And his feet are like flailing in the air.
461000	463000	There you go.
463000	464000	Kill that.
473000	477000	Um, this guy is like, um...
477000	484440	It's like, imagine if you have one leg on the ground and your back leg is sticking out
484440	487960	straight behind you and your arms are to your sides.
487960	488960	Yeah.
488960	495960	He's doing yoga, that's what he's doing.
495960	505320	Um, it's just like a guy, he kinda looks like the Yoda one, but he's more of a rectangle,
505320	510320	it's not the one where he has no arms or legs, it's just like the Yoda one, but he's kind
510320	513320	of like a rectangle for a body with the right side kinda cut off.
513320	514320	Oh, you're making me laugh again.
514320	525320	I can't really hear you, so I'm just gonna, um, it's a square head and it's like a diamond,
525320	529320	and his shoulders, he's like sitting on the ground and his shoulders are completely flat
529320	533320	and straight, the left side of his body is a complete rectangle and the right side has
533320	534320	like some stuff cut out of it.
534320	535320	Can you hear me?
535320	536320	Sophia, can you hear me?
536320	537320	I can't hear you.
537320	538320	You can?
538320	539320	Like, just barely.
539320	540320	Like, I can't think out your words, really.
540320	541320	Well, that's a problem.
541320	542320	Oh, then you want to go.
542320	543320	Well, yeah, I know.
543320	558320	Um, okay, this is like, it kinda looks like a guy, but he's more of a rectangle for a
559320	566320	Okay, this is like, it kinda looks like a woman is wearing a dress and like something
566320	571320	is sticking out of the dress on the bottom right, and then some long thing is also sticking
571320	572320	out on the left.
572320	573320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
573320	574320	Kill that, kill that, kill that.
574320	587320	Um, this is a dog and it's sitting down, it's kind of, it's sitting on the ground,
588320	592320	it kinda looks like a dog is like waiting for like a tree or waiting for a command.
592320	597320	It's like hind legs are bent down and it's front ones are like sticking out and on the
597320	598320	ground.
598320	601320	Oh my god, I did it again.
601320	604320	Guys, I knew it was that one, obviously.
604320	605320	That's the only dog.
605320	606320	Oh my god.
606320	611320	I'm like getting confused with this, um, scrolling shit.
611320	614320	I'm so sorry.
614320	617320	I know that.
617320	624320	Sorry, I can hear someone talking, but I don't know if you're talking to me because I can't.
624320	628320	Well, can you describe what you're supposed to describe?
628320	630320	Let's go.

688320	692320	Their knees are bent and they're looking down and like they kind of look like they're like
692320	696320	a Minecraft character because their head is like a square and it looks like attached to
696320	698320	their body at the time.

737320	740320	Oh, yeah, I remember exactly which one.
740320	744320	It's like two squares overlapping attached to a top little part.
744320	751320	Um, it's kind of like a cherry, but instead of two cherries being next to each other,
751320	753320	they're one below the other.

755320	756320	Okay.
758320	770320	Um, this kind of looks like, okay, so there's this guy and they're facing to their right
770320	773320	and their knees are half bent, but they're still standing up.
773320	776320	They look like they're like begging for food maybe.
776320	777320	Yeah.
777320	780320	Yeah, okay, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be.
780320	795320	Um, so this is just like a flat thing with a square kind of sticking up out of a bump
795320	796320	on the top of it.
796320	799320	It could be like, I guess like, um.
799320	802320	Uh, like a, like a shoe.
802320	807320	Um, it's kind of, I'm not, uh, hmm.
807320	808320	Hey, look at the other one.
808320	809320	It's the shoe.
809320	810320	I don't know what you're saying.
810320	811320	I'm sorry.
811320	812320	What?
812320	816320	It's like, um, like a flat kind of oval-ish thing, or it's not an oval.
816320	817320	It's a hexagon.
817320	822320	Um, but the two main sides are long and it has a little bump in the top.
822320	834320	And then it has, yeah, there you go.
834320	838320	This is a house and to its right, it has just like a really tall rectangular building.
838320	839320	Yep.
839320	840320	Um, handstand again.
840320	853320	The person's doing a handstand, but this part of it only looks like they have one foot.
853320	855320	No, no, that's not right.
855320	861320	Oh, I don't know which one you're talking about.
861320	862320	Handstand.
862320	865320	It's like, it looks like a baby.
866320	871320	It looks like they have two hands on the ground and their head is like on the bottom of the
871320	872320	drawing.
872320	876320	And then it looks like their legs are in the air and they're, and they're like one of their
876320	877320	legs.
877320	880320	It's just like a little triangle almost disconnected from the, sorry, not like speed.
880320	881320	Okay.
881320	882320	I got it.
882320	890320	I got it.
890320	894320	This is just like a cup.
894320	897320	It's just like a little, like a bowl.
897320	901320	Kind of like the boat thing from before, but it has like an opening on the top.
901320	903320	Yep.
912320	918320	This looks like a person is riding on the dog and the dog is jumping in the air.
918320	919320	I got it.
919320	921320	The person is just like two blocks.
921320	923320	It's like a baby.
932320	933320	Okay.
933320	935320	This is very similar to the last one.
935320	940320	It is like a person on top of the dog, but it kind of looks like the dog is a boat and
940320	942320	the person is sitting inside the dog almost.
942320	945320	You can only see their torso and their head.
945320	947320	Yeah.
949320	950320	Okay.
950320	964320	This is a person with no arms or legs with a weird bump on the right side of their body.
964320	965320	They're sitting down.
965320	966320	That's why.
966320	967320	Okay.
967320	969320	Maybe they're sitting down, but okay.
979320	980320	Okay.
980320	983320	This is similar to the one where the guy's knees are bent and he's praying, but they're
983320	990320	a little bit skinnier and they have like something coming out of their, it looks like they're
990320	995320	leaning against, like they're sitting kind of on a little stoop, but it's kind of like
995320	998320	they look like the guy who's like praying, but they're kind of standing straight up and
998320	1000320	they're like, you kind of look, or not praying, like begging.
1000320	1001320	Yeah, there you go.
1012320	1018320	So this looks like somebody is walking forward with their, towards the left and their arms
1018320	1022320	are sticking straight out to the left and they have like one leg in front and one leg
1022320	1023320	behind.
1023320	1024320	I'm going, I'm going.
1037320	1038320	Okay.
1038320	1041320	This looks like a guy who's wearing a top hat and he's facing the right and he's kicking
1041320	1045320	his hand out and he has like, you can see both of his feet right next to each other.
1045320	1047320	It kind of looks like he's like rapping or something.
1048320	1051320	He's like, he looks like he's like saying something and he has a top hat on.
1054320	1055320	I don't see him.
1056320	1060320	Or maybe his head just like isn't a diamond, it's a square, but it kind of looks like he's
1060320	1061320	wearing a top hat.
1061320	1062320	Is it like Elvis?
1063320	1064320	What?
1064320	1065320	Is it like Elvis?
1067320	1070320	I can't, I don't know, I can't hear you.
1071320	1072320	Yeah.
1072320	1073320	It kind of, yeah, that's it.
1073320	1075320	That was very bad of you.
1076320	1079320	I don't know if you would just insult me because I can't hear you.
1080320	1081320	I did.
1081320	1082320	Okay.
1082320	1086320	Uh, I, the first time I saw this, I thought it looked exactly like a duck.
1087320	1090320	It kind of looks like a duck like swimming through the water kicking one of its feet out.
1091320	1092320	Yeah, yeah.
1102320	1110320	This looks like, um, it kind of looks like, okay, the bottom part of this picture is a
1110320	1113320	it's just like a flat triangle with like a little bit of a bump in it.
1114320	1118320	And then the top just has like a head and like two huge ears connected to it.
1118320	1125320	I don't know if it's like a person, but imagine you wearing two huge ears on your head and
1125320	1128320	then sticking up and you're facing right and you're like sitting down.
1129320	1131320	It's like a disappointed bunny.
1133320	1134320	Yeah.
1140320	1145320	Um, okay.
1146320	1153320	So it kind of looks like a guy whose head is a diamond and it's like connected to the
1153320	1156320	rest of his body, which at the top half of it is a diamond.
1156320	1159320	He is like holding a martini glass in his left hand.
1160320	1162320	Um, but you can't really see the hand.
1162320	1165320	You can just kind of see like this triangle sticking out of the side of his body.
1165320	1167320	So it's kind of like a martini glass.
1167320	1168320	Yeah.
1170320	1182320	This is just like a dinosaur.
1182320	1186320	If it had no legs, it's just like the body and the neck or the draft draft.
1186320	1189320	Maybe it's a body and the neck and the head.
1189320	1190320	Yeah.
1200320	1201320	Okay.
1230320	1232320	Okay.
