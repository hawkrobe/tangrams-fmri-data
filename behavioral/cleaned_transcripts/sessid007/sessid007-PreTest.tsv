0	17920	Yep, thank you.
47920	55920	So, it has like a rhombus on top. It kind of looks like someone is like begging almost.
55920	63920	Kind of a tilted trapezoid on bottom. Kind of a fairly streamlined middle section.
63920	66920	And then on the right side, there's like a triangle on the right side.
66920	68920	Okay, I got it.
69920	71920	Okay.
83920	88920	Okay, so on the top, there are two separate triangles.
88920	94920	And then there's a square kind of midway towards the middle.
94920	96920	Press the wrong button.
101920	107920	Okay, so rhombus on the top towards the right.
107920	110920	And then on the left around the middle, there's an upside down triangle.
110920	112920	So the point is on the bottom.
112920	123920	So like rhombus on top and then on the left towards the middle, there's an upside down triangle.
123920	129920	And then on the bottom left, there's kind of like a foot almost.
129920	135920	It kind of looks like a person facing left.
135920	139920	I'm trying to think here.
140920	148920	And then on the right, like the entire right side almost is like a triangle.
148920	151920	A triangle pointing to the right.
155920	157920	Let's see here.
161920	163920	Could you run through that description again?
163920	165920	Yeah, so I'm looking at the other ones.
166920	169920	Because there's a bunch of like rhombus on top.
169920	177920	So this one has, so the biggest factor is there's an upside down triangle on the left side.
177920	183920	Like resting, it kind of looks like it's resting on someone's lap almost.
183920	190920	And it's not, the only point of contact of this triangle is on one other piece.
190920	201920	And I think it's the only one that I can see with that like triangle touching one piece on the left side.
201920	204920	Okay, that helps.
204920	206920	Okay, great.
206920	221920	Okay, so this one, there's two that, there's one that looks a little similar to it I think.
221920	224920	It kind of looks like someone's like raising their hands up.
224920	235920	And so there are, but in this case instead of a, actually so on the top there are three distinct kind of like triangle shapes.
235920	241920	But not, like there's not a single rhombus shape on this figure.
241920	249920	And then on the bottom right it looks like the right side of a parallelogram kind of trapezoid figure.
250920	255920	And let's see, oh nice.
262920	271920	Okay, so this one is towards, let's see, I think it's the only one that kind of looks like it.
271920	275920	So the bottom part is just an upside down trapezoid.
275920	281920	And then on top of it on the right and left side there are two parallelograms that face in.
281920	285920	And then the empty space at the top forms a trapezoid.
285920	287920	Okay, yeah.
300920	302920	Okay, this one's got a lot going on.
302920	313920	Okay, so at the top there is a rhombus and at the bottom right there is a triangle, an upside down like a triangle pointing downward.
313920	320920	And the only point of contact with the triangle is with another triangle on the bottom right.
320920	330920	So like the top left of this triangle is touching the bottom right of another one in the furthest bottom right corner of the shape.
332920	340920	Does that, do you need any more?
340920	343920	Is there a rhombus on the top? Like a tilted square?
343920	345920	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
345920	346920	Okay.
357920	362920	Okay, this one, it kind of looks like someone's like figure skating.
362920	372920	There's a rhombus on the top left and then on the right there's a triangle pointing upwards around the middle.
372920	373920	Great.
375920	376920	Okay.
381920	386920	Okay, this one kind of looks like someone's walking with a backpack and they're facing the right.
386920	391920	So on top there's a square and then...
392920	394920	Alright.
400920	410920	Okay, so on this one the furthest right shape is a triangle pointing like southwest.
410920	419920	And then on the left side there's a part of a trapezoid pointing to the left.
419920	424920	And then there's like a square on top that's a little bit tilted.
428920	433920	Let's see, it's like, it doesn't really look like anything in my opinion.
433920	447920	But I think the kind of tilted triangle on the right side, on the bottom right, pointing southwest, I don't see anything else like that of the options.
447920	453920	Is there like a raw, I guess it's a parallelogram on the left side?
453920	454920	Yeah.
455920	456920	Okay.
460920	461920	Great.
461920	477920	Okay, so this one on the top there's a rhombus and its only point of contact is with a triangle pointing up.
477920	484920	And then it looks like a, kind of like a scale on the bottom.
484920	488920	It's the flattest of all the shapes.
488920	491920	Or like the, yeah I guess flattest.
491920	494920	It's more horizontal than vertical is probably what I'm looking for.
494920	500920	Does it have like two triangles on each side, like one on the left and one on the right?
500920	502920	Yeah, yeah.
502920	523920	Okay, so this one, it kind of looks like someone's wearing bunny ears and is facing to their right.
523920	530920	So the top has two triangles that are connected to the top left corner of a square.
530920	531920	Uh huh.
532920	533920	Yeah.
534920	535920	Great.
535920	536920	Okay.
544920	549920	Okay, this one just looks like a, it looks like a four legged animal facing the left.
551920	552920	Where?
552920	556920	Where the head is like a parallelogram pointing left.
556920	557920	Yeah.
569920	572920	Okay, so this one is tilted.
572920	579920	It's, the top part is at the left, the bottom goes like, it goes top left to bottom right.
579920	585920	And then the bottom left is a triangle pointing northeast.
588920	592920	It kind of looks like a tray that's been tilted.
592920	596920	And let's see.
599920	600920	Yeah.
600920	615920	Okay, so this one is pretty skinny vertically.
615920	626920	It has a rhombus on top that's touching, it's not just touching at one point, it's kind of touching about half of the left side of it.
626920	632920	And then it's a pretty like vertical structure, but the bottom right has a triangle pointing right.
632920	634920	Oh shoot, that one too.
634920	635920	My B.
635920	636920	Okay.
638920	640920	I didn't see that one.
643920	648920	Okay, this one just looks like a backwards seven, like the number.
648920	657920	So it's got like a upside down trapezoid pointing to the right on top, and then a skinny little rectangle on the left side.
657920	686920	Okay, this one also, it kind of looks like a jumping animal where the head is on the left side, the tail is on the right.
686920	694920	It's a triangle that's only touching at one point, and the triangle is pointing to the right.
698920	701920	Does it have like a square?
701920	703920	Yeah, like the top middle.
703920	705920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
717920	723920	Okay, this kind of looks like a person holding out a tray.
723920	740920	So the top is a rhombus, and then it's got this like little cut off upside down trapezoid and then like a square connected to the trapezoid on the left, like around the middle of the shape.
741920	747920	The like body of the shape is almost just a rectangle.
747920	757920	There's like a little bit of, there's a triangle at the top that's like touching the rhombus, but it's mostly rectangular.
757920	761920	It, I'm trying to discern because there's a few that kind of look like this.
762920	782920	The difference, I'd say, between this and the other ones that look like it is, it's like a, it's a little wider, like the left trapezoid is like protrudes out more than anything else of this shape.
782920	786920	And it's pointing left, whereas all the other ones point right.
786920	792920	Is the rectangle, does it have a triangle on the right, or is it just a rectangle?
792920	795920	So, no, no, no, no, I see what you're talking about.
795920	803920	So it's like the right side of the figure is completely flat, except for a triangle towards the top that's pointing up.
805920	808920	And then at the bottom, okay, cool.
816920	826920	Okay, this one kind of looks like another four-legged animal where the head is facing, is on the left side, and it's a triangle pointed up.
826920	833920	And then the tail is a parallelogram with the right side pointing towards the top right.
837920	840920	It's, yeah, cool.
847920	857920	Okay, so this is the one that you clicked earlier that was really vertical, and it has two, yeah, sounds like a cactus.
870920	874920	Okay, this one looks like a house with a tree on the left.
876920	878920	Okay.
882920	884920	Oh.
884920	909920	Okay, this one has a rhombus pointed, like a rhombus on top, and its only point of contact is with a flat rectangle.
910920	916920	On that rectangle, there's also a triangle pointing to the right, but midway up it.
916920	935920	Okay, this one is the other one that I thought kind of looked like someone raising their arms up.
935920	949920	So the head is a rhombus with like one point of contact with kind of a flat space. It's tilted towards the top left, and like the, yeah.
949920	970920	Okay, this one's kind of tricky. So this one has a triangle with one point of contact near the top right.
970920	985920	And the left side of the figure is like kind of a mix of a bunch of shapes. On top, there's a rhombus that's like, it's connecting the right triangle with everything else on the left.
985920	998920	Let's see. And then the bottom left has a triangle pointed upward that's connected, not to a few places.
998920	1013920	Okay.
1013920	1034920	Okay, so this one has a rhombus on the top and a very flat, it's connected to like a very flat, wide base. And then the base kind of gets skinnier towards the bottom, where the bottom is like a cutoff triangle almost.
1034920	1048920	And then the, so like the left side is completely rectangular, like completely flat, there's nothing. And then the right side has some angles kind of decreasing.
1048920	1057920	Let's see. I think it's the only one with a rhombus on top with a completely straight left side.
1057920	1071920	Okay, yeah.
1071920	1086920	Okay, this one kind of looks like a person sitting down facing the left. So the top is a rhombus, but it's kind of like, it's a little more tilted than all the other ones.
1086920	1106920	And then the bottom left is a triangle facing downward that's kind of connected to another straight figure.
1106920	1124920	Okay, this one kind of looks like an animal. So the bottom left of this one is a triangle pointed northwest. And it's only touching at one point.
1124920	1136920	I think it's the only one that's like, yeah.
1136920	1145920	Okay, this one.
1145920	1153920	This one is like slanted, where the top is at the left and the bottom is at the top left to bottom right.
1153920	1171920	The top left of it is a triangle pointed upward, but it's connected to like another trapezoid figure.
1171920	1181920	And then the bottom right is a triangle pointed southeast.
1181920	1195920	Yeah.
1195920	1213920	Okay, so the top is a rhombus touching a flat side where the left side is completely flat and then the right is like a triangle inverted, coming back in.
1213920	1226920	And so the flat left side does go into form, like the empty space is a triangle on the left side before it picks up again.
1226920	1241920	And then the lowest part of the entire figure is at the bottom right. And it's like a trapezoid parallelogram type figure pointed downward, down a little bit to the right.
1241920	1246920	Let's try to see.
1246920	1268920	Yeah, so I think rhombus on top and then the lowest point in the figure is the bottom right, with a kind of trapezoid triangle pointing down to the right as well.
1268920	1271920	Let's see.
1271920	1284920	Okay, yeah.
1284920	1293920	Okay, so this one has a rhombus on top and its point of contact is a triangle pointed upward.
1293920	1302920	And then it kind of looks like someone's on their knees and they're facing towards the right.
1302920	1312920	There's another triangle connected, let's see, actually, there's a rhombus on top connected to a triangle pointed upward.
1312920	1328920	And then there's like the left side forms, like the blank space of the left side kind of forms a diamond almost.
1328920	1333920	Does it kind of look like a woman kneeling reading a book?
1333920	1347920	Yes, yes.
1347920	1363920	This is a house with like a chimney on the right side.
1363920	1376920	Okay, this one looks like someone walking to the left. So the top is a rhombus, the bottom left is a triangle pointed downward.
1376920	1385920	It's like the middle part is the skinniest, it's like a very skinny, it gets like very skinny in the middle.
1385920	1389920	And it looks like a guy wearing a flip-flop pants.
1389920	1404920	Yeah, yeah.
1404920	1409920	This one looks like a dog with like something on its back.
1409920	1419920	So the head is on the left side and then the tail is a triangle pointed upward and it's like barely touching the rest of the figure.
1419920	1432920	That's on the right side.
1432920	1458920	Okay, this one is got a really long skinny rectangle on the left and then the base, it just looks like a big owl.
1458920	1463920	This one kind of looks like an upside down tree almost.
1463920	1486920	It's like the top is a rectangle, a flat rectangle and the bottom is like a diamond pointed down and then there's like another similar diamond, like two of them.
1486920	1493920	Okay, the top of this one is a triangle that's barely touching everything else and the triangle is pointed to the left.
1493920	1512920	And then the bottom, there's like a square towards the bottom, it looks like someone's like holding it facing the left.
1512920	1525920	Okay, this one looks like there's someone walking to the left and they're like stepping up and then on the back is a square that's like kind of touching the rest of the figure but not really.
1525920	1527920	Okay.
1527920	1529920	Great, cool.
1529920	1537920	Okay.
