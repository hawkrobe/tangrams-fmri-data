0	20320	okay to me it looks like someone is like a diver there's like two triangles right at
20320	27320	the bottom it's all centered and then kind of like it moves the whole way up on the bottom
27320	35000	middle to the top middle and there's like two arms coming off from the right hand side
35000	43080	like a block at the top and then like a thinner longer rectangle that goes into a triangle on the
43640	61160	side yes on the back yeah i think i got it okay okay um again i kind of see it it's like
61160	65480	it's like a house on the right with like a mushroom like a tree on the left hand side
66200	68200	okay
79240	86360	ah okay um so using the same thing whilst using like the body before this one's like
87320	92840	someone who has something in the air so like two smaller triangles in the middle towards the top
93560	97320	moving down it's a two thicker ones towards the bottom one touching the bottom
97960	104520	one a bit more in the air with like a block around halfway up okay that makes sense okay
116680	121000	okay um using the same analogy this to me looks like someone on their
121000	128280	knees there's like a triangle small to the left hand side um and then they pick up blocks on the
128280	135320	to the right of that and then towards the top there's going to have two triangles um coming
135320	141480	out once completely flat once slightly splatted up i like the head is between the two tilted to
141480	147400	the one point is between the tip of the two triangles i don't think there's anything else
147400	153960	i can say um it's all quite central um one of the shorter ones okay
166600	173320	okay um so this i'm visualizing as someone kind of with their hands out so there's the
174120	181320	um tilted square at the top and it moves down there's like one big block that goes the whole
181320	187080	way down the little triangle right at the bottom like a larger part that comes out on the left
187880	191480	with like like a square and there's like a bit on top which i could use a bit
191560	194840	um okay all on the left yeah
207320	208360	okay um
210680	215800	so this kind of thing we like to want where they go like a horse in a way i don't know so there's
215800	222520	like a long body that runs from the left to the right which has like a triangle on the left hand
222520	230920	side um tilted up and another one on the right hand side is tilted more and only just the tip
230920	237160	touches the rest of the body it has like two legs um on either side as if it's looking that
237800	245000	and then there's in the center um leading upwards there's a triangle there's a square attached to
245000	252120	that leading kind of forwards towards the left
252120	259240	so
267960	277240	okay um so right at the top of this one there is a triangle with the point pointing left it's quite
277240	285080	small and there's a longer body which runs down to the bottom but the tip of the triangle at the
285080	293000	top is like the leftmost point aligned with a kind of tilted square which is near the bottom
293800	297880	the rest is kind of like a i don't know how to describe that shape this is like a
298760	303080	something longer a lot longer shape that has three things protruding out to it to the left
303080	310920	the middle one has this like you square since you want it
326200	332440	okay this is some of the one we had before um where to me it looks like someone
332440	339080	writing some sort of animal so there's the um there's a triangle at the far right which is
339080	344760	slightly tilted down and totally just attached to the rest of the body um there had less looks
344760	350760	like it has as you have two legs but mildly jumping move towards the left the far left side
350760	357080	there's like two triangles and protruding they're coming up from the middle there is
357800	363320	a rectangular shape that leans left and then a square on top of there
364760	379720	that's all on top of the um kind of m shape body that runs from left to right
379720	388200	um okay so
390280	396520	this one has like one arm the protrudes very clearly down towards at the left hand corner of
396520	402600	the image um it has like three main upper arms one which is above it towards the top left
403160	406280	and one bound towards the bottom right it kind of arches down
406280	408760	um
413640	420760	that's kind of like a right angled thing at the top um there would be three different arms
421560	425240	top left
435640	445400	um okay so at the top of this one there is kind of the head like square um and then it moves down
446360	453400	with a two things protruding on the right hand side um which looks to me it's like knees and
453400	460200	something with a kind of hands out um and then it kind of goes back towards the left right at the
460200	469000	bottom
475080	484280	okay um so again at the top of this one there is a square which like a diamond shape and slightly
484280	490200	off center towards the right um the rest of the thing that runs down looks kind of like a tree to
490200	498200	me um it has like a flatter side about halfway up on the left and then it continues as a whole
498200	501880	body the whole way down and it kind of goes out at the bottom yeah
504680	509320	i'm feeling like a kind of numbness on one of my hands like a pinzu needle type thing i don't know
509400	515560	if that's what did you say i was just trying to say to people that i'm feeling like a numbness
515560	527000	in one of my hands like a pinzu needle type thing um so this
529880	536520	looks very clean in the way that it has two legs like shoes one is planted on the floor one is
536520	547080	going up towards the left um and above that there is like a diamond shape like peering over the
547080	553160	side on the left and a square on the right just like it's sliding off like it would fall just
553160	559800	fall off on the right
564520	571960	okay um this one again has kind of the same diamond thing right at the top slightly off
571960	580360	center to the left um and then it has kind of strange shape i don't have to describe it um
580920	587800	just like i like the diamond's right until like a flat line on the left this goes straight down
587800	592840	then there's a gap and then it goes to like a arrow thing on the right from the top it starts
592840	598040	protruding out immediately goes towards the left and then just like a long line down towards the
598120	602360	right um well there's like kind of two gaps to get out of there we don't know how to describe
602360	603640	this one okay strange
609640	618200	yeah i'm not really sure which one this is okay um so so it's like a block that has
619800	627080	two legs one of them is more very one straight one's kind of like kind of arced in a way
628280	633720	uh look kind of like a claw um that's all of the more on the left hand side um
635960	636440	and then
650440	655480	has a quite solid rectangular shape at the bottom
656360	661880	opportunity um it goes on the left hand side up towards the top of the triangle right at the top
673000	678280	it's one of the more sophisticated one of the what it's one of the simpler shapes is there
679240	681880	um it's kind of just like the one big block at the bottom
698760	706920	okay um so it then it has the kind of diamond thing in the middle of
707640	712360	or the first thing would just be one rectangle that has like a bike out of it on the right hand
712360	719400	side it's the best way to explain it um otherwise it would be like just one rectangle
719480	725880	now
729640	736520	i'm not really sure which one this is okay um so again it's one of the more simplistic ones
737400	739560	it's the diamond on top of a
741560	746920	a shape which is completely flat on the left hand side when it comes down to the bottom
747800	751640	the same on the top of the bottom but the top is longer than the bottom
752760	756200	the right one kind of like arches down this yes that's what
767640	772600	um so Mickey it's one just it's one of the most interesting ones again it looks like a crab to me
773320	778280	oh yeah i think i know which one you're talking about okay cool yeah
789320	800680	um okay so it has the diamond thing at the top um let me just connect on to
803000	807880	it kind of looks like a mean person this was a bit hard um
811400	813160	shape at the bottom is kind of like a
814840	823480	um a triangle which has a flat side running top to bottom on the left and stops just
823480	829480	shining like a bird i'm saying and on the bottom kind of runs in the middle part and then it kind
829480	837400	of goes up a little bit like an e-type shape to me um this was a little bit difficult i don't know
837400	839320	what to say
853240	860360	this is like a house or a fire on the left and then a chimney or like a tall tower to the right
867880	870360	so
874360	881560	um this one is very narrow very central um like a fit line that runs down with two
882520	885720	like kind of triangle yeah
899880	907000	um kind of quite simplistic there's it's having to think of the top and then one kind of body
907000	914440	that runs down kind of triangle at the top that runs down top to bottom but then right at the
914440	919080	bottom it kind of goes towards the right isn't it like a keep going ahead and move towards the right
919640	923160	so
936440	940280	this was i guess i didn't say what we were speaking of the same this is the one you did before
942680	946200	the one i just did the last one yeah yeah the same shape okay
949080	956200	so
966360	973480	weirdly quite dumb especially my left hand side now um very heavy printed needles and i can't really
973480	975880	feel them that well i can like overfill them
979880	987480	this one diamond shape on the top long protruding thing around halfway down the left hand side
988200	991400	the right one goes the right side goes right down the bottom right corner
992280	995640	um and there's like a little triangle at the bottom right
995640	1005800	okay
1013560	1020520	um okay it looks like someone dancing to me so it has like the diamond head of the top
1021240	1027720	but it's not kind of pointed up like the rest is more to one side so it's basically would be
1027720	1033880	kind of flat but it's very slightly down um it's right it's kind of on the right side it's connected
1033880	1039480	to kind of a thin part which then runs down into a bigger block at the bottom
1040040	1043640	does a triangle on the right and it's not going to be
1043720	1055800	harder than that
1062840	1069800	um
1073720	1080680	it looks like two um switching up the one on the right is more diamondy the one on the left is more
1080680	1087800	flat but it has like a body shape and runs from the top left to the top bottom top right straight
1087800	1094520	so it's a top left bottom right does it almost look like it's flying like it's what say like it's
1094520	1098680	flying yeah
1108040	1118680	um this looks like some sort of bird creature it has like a kind of like a swan swimming yes
1118680	1124840	yeah
1130200	1136840	okay this looks like someone dancing with one foot planted one foot is
1137800	1145320	out to the right and their arms are to the left yes correct okay this goes well
1149240	1158280	okay this looks like someone walking towards the left with a like a large pace
1159960	1167800	okay um did their legs kind of make like a 90 degree angle uh yeah in a way the one
1167800	1171320	on the right is more flat at the bottom one left yeah
1179400	1190200	okay this is not really keeping as a shape it runs from the top left to the bottom right
1191160	1196840	um and it's kind of like a single block that kind of wiggles in the way the top right the bottom
1196840	1202200	left kind of have these triangles look like they're kind of like folded over and there's two like
1202280	1205720	yeah cool
1212600	1215000	okay this looks kind of like
1216840	1222760	the crab creature with a tail and a more pronounced head and I still have a solid
1224760	1229240	it's the tail pointing to the right it does yeah it comes down towards the right
1232360	1235240	so
1240680	1247240	this is like someone who is kind of sat down louch against the wall and then these
1247320	1252280	beds and their feet down the bottom left corner the head kind of tilting down
1264760	1270040	this looks like a prancing horse um the bottom left leg goes a lot lower than the right one
1270680	1274280	has got like a tail that goes up with the far right side
1277240	1280280	so
1285000	1289800	this one doesn't really look like anything but it's like it's got the square bit at the top which is
1291240	1296280	centered in the glass and there's like two diamonds that are kind of overlapping each other
1296840	1298280	oh yeah
1307240	1310280	um
1314920	1320280	it's like a disc that runs across the diamond on top
1321000	1323320	so
1339960	1343720	so it's got like a diamond bit at the bottom and a flat bar
1343720	1347880	that's kind of on top of the diamond shape and then two arms one of which is
1348760	1355880	um kind of pointy one is flat and it's tilted to the um kind of leading towards the bottom right
1355880	1360040	okay cool
1365720	1366040	um
1368520	1374040	it's the only one you went to the diamond head that's kind of like buddy is
1378280	1383560	wait what was that there's got like the diamond head thing it has two triangles coming out of it
1384280	1387720	oh okay it's like out of the top oh yeah
1402680	1410280	okay this looks again kind of like a dog he's coming up to his shoulder like towards the right
1410280	1427000	so now you have like a triangle tail on the left hand side okay
1440280	1445000	so
