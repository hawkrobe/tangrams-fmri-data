0	29000	Okay, this looks like a person, but there's no arms, square head, uh, no arms, no arms,
29000	47000	square head, uh, there's like a sum of bent knees towards the right. Yeah. This also
47000	54000	looks like a person, um, square head towards the right, and there's an upside down triangle
54000	59000	on the left. Uh, wait, before I select, I realize there's a lot with upside down triangles
59000	66000	on the left. Um, I guess it looks like there's an arm that's like reached out, but like it's
66000	71000	only the torso of the person, so ignore the ones where the person looks like they're fully
71000	76000	standing. So just the torso of a person with an arm reached out, holding onto a triangle,
77000	84000	can only see like that left arm, and that again, the head is on the right, like top right.
84000	92000	And you said the person is facing left? Uh, like the arm is like left, like it's an, like
92000	96000	the left arm is the one that's outreaching, but the person is kind of, like I don't think
96000	102000	it's really facing any particular direction. Um, the head is on the right though. Okay,
102000	108000	and there's no like triangle sticking out anywhere, right? There's a triangle sticking
108000	115000	out on the left. It looks like the person's like holding, like balancing a triangular
115000	131000	ball. Uh, any questions or, like there's a triangle on the left that it looks like the
131000	138000	person's like holding or balancing. Uh, is there also a triangle on the right side? Uh,
138000	144000	not really. I mean that triangle on the right side is like, I guess there is a like a large
144000	150000	triangle on the right side that just like makes up the person's torso. Okay, and the
150000	160000	arms are not like in the air, right? You can only see one arm? Only one arm. Oh yeah, sorry.
161000	175000	No, you're good. Okay, uh, another person on the knees, um, there's like two arms that
175000	183000	are represented as like two triangles, like two relatively large triangles, um, and you
183000	191000	can see the legs sticking out on like the bottom left. So again, like person on the
191000	198000	ground, uh, legs sticking out on the left, uh, which kind of looks like two triangles
198000	213000	and then they are also, yeah, perfect. Okay, this looks like the one that had like the
213000	220000	dog and then, uh, either a person like biting the dog or like balancing on the dog. Um,
220000	241000	but that dog is like, looks like it's running towards the left. Yeah, perfect. Okay, uh,
241000	247000	this person looks like they're jumping in the air, but you don't see any arms. It's
247000	252000	just two arms. Uh, no, no, you don't see any legs. No, just two arms are like sticking
252000	269000	up like raised. Perfect. Okay, this person looks like they're balancing, like, oh, they're
270000	277000	onto the square. Um, it's the one that you previously described as like, well, uh, it's
277000	295000	like the triangle heads, um, and then like rectangular legs. Perfect. Okay, this looks
295000	304000	like a dog, uh, but with a triangle head, um, triangle legs. Uh, let's see. Is it facing
304000	322000	to the left? Yeah, facing to the left. It's a triangle head, uh, no person on it. Perfect.
322000	331000	This is the one that previously was like the glasses, um, like the slightly diagonal.
331000	360000	Perfect. Yeah, perfect. This looks like the tilted scale. Uh, this looks like a dog,
360000	369000	that was like falling. Um, so like the head is on the ground, uh, and there's like three
369000	374000	points up in the air. Um, like it's like three triangles, not only in the air, but like three
374000	380000	triangles on the top of this shape. Um, and to me, it kind of looks like a upside down
380000	389000	duck or a goose or something. I heard, uh, is there a square head? Is there like a square
389000	395000	on top or no, no, no, it's just like three triangles on the top. And then the bottom
395000	403000	is a parallelogram, like parallelogram head that's on the ground. Um, the back is like
403000	420000	a diagonal rectangle. Cool. This is the one that like looks almost symmetrical, but it
420000	436000	has like a long pole. Uh, yeah, cool. This is the one that doesn't really look like anything
436000	445000	particular. Um, this is like a large parallelogram on the top and then a bar on the left and
445000	450000	then like a square under like connecting at the bottom of the bar. Those squares are
450000	455000	a lot smaller than the parallelogram top, uh, but not any particular shapes. It just
455000	481000	looks like a left corner, like 90 degree angle. Oh, I see. This looks like a person
481000	490000	who's balancing on one leg and, uh, another leg is like sticking up in the air, but that
490000	497000	leg is just like two triangles. Um, there's also two arms like reaching out to the left.
497000	514000	The arms are reaching out on the left side, right? Yeah. So perfect. This looks like some
514000	537000	kind of animal, uh, like square, no legs, just a rectangle body. Um, yeah. This looks
537000	545000	like, oh, this is the one that you like previously misplaced. Um, person with an arm, uh, facing
545000	558000	to the left. Um, like fully full body standing. Oh, I forgot which one I. Oh, so it, so there's
558000	573000	like a square head, uh, rectangle body. The right side is just flat. Like it's just horizontal.
573000	594000	This looks like the house, uh, with a chimney roof with a triangle on top of the chimney.
594000	604000	This looks like the symmetrical bow tie or like tie. It's also like the only symmetrical
604000	622000	image. Perfect. This looks like a person again, but the left side is completely flat and then
622000	629000	the right side is just like a triangle towards like the top of the person. Um, I guess this
629000	634000	shape is slightly less humanoid than the other ones, but it's still vaguely looks like a
634000	661000	person. Yeah. Cool.
661000	674000	Okay. Got it. Cool. Yeah. My head feels fine. Cool.
