0	2000	You
9040	11720	Got it. Thanks. Okay. I'm ready
24480	28880	Okay, this looks like a person but there's no arms scared head
30560	33400	There's like somewhat bent knees towards the right
35240	37240	Yeah
46080	48080	This also looks like a person
49760	55040	Square head towards the right and there's an upside-down triangle on the left
55040	57040	I
61560	63560	Guess it looks like this
72160	76700	A torso of a person with an arm reached out holding on to a triangle
77360	82880	And can only see like that left arm and that again the head is on the right like top
82880	86320	Oh, right, and you said the person is facing left
87720	93480	Like the arm is like left like it's like the left arm is one of the outreaching
93560	98640	But the person is kind of like I don't think it's really facing any particular direction
99240	101240	The head is on the right
101400	103280	okay, and
103280	108680	There's no like triangle sticking out anywhere. There's a triangle sticking out on the left
109680	115680	It looks like that person's like holding like balancing a triangular ball
127840	133520	Like there's a triangle on the left that it looks like the person's like holding over bouncing
134560	136880	Is there also a triangle on the right side?
137480	138440	Uh
138440	141240	Not really. I mean that triangle on the right side is like I
141840	147720	Guess it isn't like a large triangle on the right side that just like makes up the person's torso
149520	154160	Okay, and the arms are not like in the air right you can only see one arm only one arm
159880	161880	Oh, yeah
167880	171120	Okay, another person on the knees
172200	177920	There's like two arms that are represented as like two triangles
178360	180440	Like two relatively large triangles
182400	185680	And you can see the leg sticking out on like the bottom left
188800	191720	So again like person on the ground
192720	200080	Like sticking out on the left, which kind of looks like two triangles and then they're also yeah, perfect
209120	213560	Okay, this looks like the one that have like the dog and then
214280	218880	Either a person like riding the dog or like balancing on the dog
219600	222680	But that dog is like looks like it's running towards the left
223920	225920	Yeah
241160	243400	This person looks like they're
244280	247720	Jumping in the air, but you don't see any arms. It's just two arms
248440	253240	Don't know you don't see any legs. They're just two arms are like sticking out like raised
253800	255800	perfect
264200	266520	This person looks like they're
267400	268520	balancing
268520	270840	Like all the holding on to the square
271800	274360	It's the one that you previously described as like
277480	281000	Triangle heads and then like
283040	285040	Rectangular legs perfect
294080	297760	It just looks like a dog with a triangle head
298760	300760	Triangle legs
305280	311200	Yeah, facing to the left it's a triangle head no person on it perfect
321560	325680	This is the one that previously was like the glasses
328120	331600	Like the slightly diagonal, yeah
342760	345000	This looks like the tilted scale
357760	359760	And
360080	363760	This looks like a duck that was like falling
364520	366720	So like the head is on the ground
367560	370520	And it's like three points up in the air
371520	376140	Like it's like three triangles. Not only in the air, but like three triangles on the top of this shape
376920	380280	And to me it kind of looks like a upside-down duck
381800	383800	Duck or goose?
384160	386160	What's up in a bird
386320	392760	Is there a square head? Is there like a square on top or no? No, it's just like three triangles on the top
392760	394760	and then the bottom is
396160	399600	Parallelogram like parallelogram head that's on the ground
401440	405540	The back is like a diagonal rectangle
414800	421160	This is the one that like looks almost symmetrical, but it has like a long pole
433680	436160	This is the one that doesn't really look like anything in particular
437200	439200	This is like a large
439880	442120	parallelogram on the top and then a
442800	446240	Bar on the left and then like a square
446920	452440	Like connecting at the bottom of the bar. The square is a lot smaller than the parallelogram on top
453200	459320	But not any particular shapes. It just looks like a left corner like 90 degree angle
464440	466440	Oh, I see
472120	474120	Oh
479440	483880	This looks like a person who's balancing on one leg and
486240	491360	Another leg is like sticking up in the air, but that leg is just like two triangles
491840	496160	There's also two arms like reaching out to the left
497760	500520	The arms are reaching out on the left side, right? Yeah
502120	504120	Perfect
512320	515160	This looks like some kind of animal
516200	519400	like square, no legs, just a
520320	522320	rectangle body
522320	524320	Kind of like a giraffe
524320	526320	Yeah, kind of like a giraffe
532120	534120	Oh
537360	542440	This is the one that you previously misclicked, a person with an arm
544200	546200	Facing to the left
549120	551400	Like fully, full body standing
555320	557320	Forgot which one I
557320	559320	So it's like a square head
560320	565120	Rectangle body, the right side is just flat, like it's just horizontal
576040	582840	This looks like the house with a chimney roof with a triangle on top of the chimney
589320	598360	This looks like the symmetrical bowtie or like tie, not necessarily a bowtie
602160	604680	It's also like the only symmetrical image, perfect
613800	618960	This looks like a person again, but the left side is completely flat
619320	621320	and then
621320	623320	the right side is just like a
624280	625520	triangle
625520	627800	Towards like the top of the person
628320	635560	I guess this shape is slightly less humanoid than the other ones, but it's still vaguely looks like a person. Yeah, cool
649320	651320	I
661200	663200	Good
669520	672680	Got it. Oh, yeah, my head feels fine
