0	29500	Okay, um, I hope you can hear me, um, the image looks like the top left corner of the
29500	34500	image has like a little square, and there's two triangles, two distinct triangles on the
34500	40500	right side. One of the triangles is on the top right, and one of them is on the bottom
40500	51500	right. The bottom left looks kind of like a chunk of an image. Does that help?
51500	55500	Am I allowed to ask questions?
56500	58500	I think so, yeah.
61500	66500	Wait, I, like, couldn't hear part of it, so you mentioned there's a square on the top
66500	69500	left, and then two distinct triangles.
69500	76500	Yeah, there's a square on the top left, and two distinct triangles. One of the triangles
76500	82500	is also like right next to the square, except on the right side, and the other triangle
82500	84500	is on the bottom right.
87500	89500	Wait, how do I scroll down?
93500	95500	Oh, okay.
99500	107500	Wait, top right square, no top left square, and triangles next to it.
107500	112500	Yeah, there's one triangle right next to the square on the right side, and one of the
112500	118500	triangles is further down, but also on the right side. And the two triangles are at different
118500	121500	angles, but they're roughly the same size.
134500	136500	Oops.
136500	140500	Yeah, oops, okay. Thank you the most.
140500	150500	Got it. Okay, this image kind of looks like a person. Like the square is a head, or rather
150500	158500	the head is a square, and it looks like they're sticking their arm out on the left side of
158500	167500	the image. So there's like a distinct head at the top, and then like kind of like one
167500	172500	arm sticking out on the left side, and there's really nothing on the right side. It's like
172500	175500	completely flat on the right side.
182500	183500	Nice.
189500	200500	Okay, this one's like kind of odd looking. It kind of looks like a bow tie, or like glasses.
200500	209500	There's like two distinct trapezoids, and it's like, it kind of looks smaller than the
209500	216500	other images. But yeah, it kind of looks like a pair of glasses. That's like the best way
216500	218500	I can think of describing it.
221500	228500	There's like, yeah, there's like a little point on the left side and on the right side,
228500	234500	and it's kind of like, the image is horizontal. Basically horizontal.
242500	243500	Nice.
247500	264500	This one also looks kind of funny, like there's a, I think it's, okay, so it's one of the
264500	271500	images with like a little triangle on the right side, and the triangle is like, it's
271500	278500	like perfectly drawn, so it's not at an angle, it's like upright, and on the top left, there's
278500	287500	like, there's a little square block on the top left. And there's like two, on the left
287500	297500	side, there's like two points. And then there's like a vertical block connecting the two points
297500	300500	to the little triangle and the square head.
302500	305500	Are the triangles on the top left or top right?
305500	310500	The triangle is on the right side, like right in the middle of the image.
315500	323500	And it looks like, it looks like there's a leg, like a vertical, like rectangle. It kind
323500	324500	of looks like a leg.
328500	329500	Nice.
338500	345500	Okay, this one, this one also kind of looks like a person. It's almost like the person
345500	352500	is like on their knees, kind of like, they look like they're praying. There's also like
352500	358500	a square head, and then the hands or the arms are on the right side.
363500	365500	Oh, I think there were two that looked similar.
368500	372500	Oh yeah, when you said on their knees, I thought that was like the other one, that was like
372500	373500	on the ground.
374500	383500	Okay, this one, this one has like, it has the head of a person, but it's almost like
383500	390500	there's no arms. It's like, it's very flat on both sides. And at the very bottom, it
390500	395500	looks like, they're kind of like, I don't know, like sitting on their knees, but it's
395500	398500	like, it's like very curled up.
400500	401500	Yeah.
403500	416500	Okay, this one, it doesn't really look like a, it kind of looks like a person, but the
416500	425500	head shape is really weird. There's like two legs, and it's not the one with the two triangles
425500	430500	as legs. Both of the legs are like, like, leg-caped.
431500	436500	Wait, can you repeat the most, like what shape are the legs?
437500	443500	It's not a triangle. It's like, it's almost like a trapezoid. It's like a triangle, but
443500	450500	on one side, there's like a rectangle. So it's like, it's like if you took a rectangle
450500	455500	and drew a triangle on top of it, that's kind of what it looks like.
455500	458500	And it's supposed to be like a humanoid shape?
458500	463500	Yeah, it's kind of like a human shape, but there's like two heads.
474500	479500	Okay, this one looks like, this one looks like a person with two arms, and the arms
479500	487500	are like raised at their head level. They're as if like, they're lifting their arms up.
492500	498500	And the head is still like a square, and each of the arms is kind of like a rhombus.
498500	501500	And there's not really any legs in the image.
506500	507500	Nice.
510500	519500	This one doesn't look like a person at all. It's like a, it's like a bracket shape.
519500	527500	There's like one long, like, kind of like a rectangle shape across the top, and then
527500	533500	on the left side, there's another rectangle shape connected to that. So it kind of looks
533500	541500	It's like a right angle, where part of it is on the top, yeah.
548500	555500	Okay, this kind of, this also kind of looks like a person that's praying, except they
555500	561500	have like a triangle on top of their head. It's kind of like a person with like a ponytail
561500	565500	that's sticking straight up, and then it also looks like they have a book in their
565500	567500	head, and they're like, they're reading a book.
567500	569500	Wait, a book and what?
569500	571500	Wait, sorry, what did you say?
571500	576500	Wait, did I just mishear, or did you say there's like a broken ankle?
576500	580500	Oh, no, no. There's like a ponytail on top of their head.
582500	583500	Ponytail?
583500	588500	Yeah, it's like, it's more like a triangle that's like vertically on top of their head,
588500	592500	and it looks like they're holding a book and like reading from the book.
604500	607500	This one also kind of looks like a person.
610500	614500	It's actually the one you selected earlier that wasn't correct.
614500	624500	It's like a person with a square head, and like two weird looking legs, and then like
624500	627500	kind of an arm that's sticking out to the right side.
630500	636500	So, so one I like misconstrued as to collect on previously.
636500	637500	Yeah.
640500	641500	Nice.
645500	655500	Okay, this one looks like a person, and the legs, they're like standing up straight, and
655500	662500	the legs are like two small triangles, and it looks like they're kind of wearing like
662500	666500	a top hat, and the arm is on the right side.
668500	670500	Wait, top hat?
670500	676500	Or, yeah, I guess the most distinct feature is like there's two legs, and the legs are
676500	682500	really tiny, like it looks like two feet, and both the feet are small rectangles, or
682500	683500	small triangles.
684500	685500	Yeah.
693500	697500	Okay, this one is also like very weird looking.
697500	700500	Oh sorry, I like misplaced the third one.
700500	701500	Okay.
708500	712500	Okay, this image is completely symmetrical.
712500	717500	It's like one of the, I think it's one of the only two images that are symmetrical,
717500	722500	and it's the one that has like a square on top of it.
727500	728500	Yeah.
735500	742500	Okay, this looks like, it doesn't look like a person anymore, but the most distinct feature
742500	751500	is like there's two small triangles on the top, like on the top of the image, and then
751500	759500	there's a square, but it's lower in the image, like on the left side, and yeah, there's
759500	769500	two triangles on the top, like two small triangles, but there's another image with a square,
769500	774500	but it's like the square is lower and on the left side of this image.
775500	783500	Uh, wait, does it happen to look like a different animal, or?
783500	792500	Yeah, I don't, it doesn't really look like an animal, like, it looks like a, I don't
792500	803500	know, like maybe like a rabbit or something, I don't know, but yeah, mostly like, yeah,
803500	807500	it's one of the like weird looking ones, sorry.
818500	824500	Okay, this one, uh, this one looks like a house, and on the left side there's like a
824500	831500	chimney, and on top of the chimney there's like a triangle, but I think it's the only
831500	833500	one that looks like a house, yeah.
839500	845500	Okay, this is, this is the other symmetrical image, so it's the one of the two symmetrical
845500	848500	images, but the one without the square.
854500	855500	Nice.
861500	868500	Okay, um, this one kind of looks like a person, uh, there's a square head, and their legs
868500	876500	are like kind of spread out, um, it looks like they're almost like, like in a, like
876500	881500	small split, or like, like maybe like running.
883500	885500	Yeah, nice.
892500	900500	Um, okay, this one, this one also looks like someone is praying, um, but it's, it's not
900500	907500	the one that, that was correct, that you selected earlier that was right, um, it's the other
907500	913500	one that looks like someone's praying, um, and there's like, their hands are out to the
913500	920500	right side, um, with a square head, and they have like a little, a little point on the
920500	925500	left side, but it looks like the hands are out to the right side.
929500	930500	Nice.
930500	948500	Um, okay, this one, this one kind of looks like a toilet, um, with like a square on top,
948500	954500	um, and then the like seat of the toilet is on the left side.
961500	962500	Nice.
969500	979500	Um, okay, this one, I think this one is, this one's the only symmetrical image out of all
979500	987500	of these, um, it looks like two squares on top of each other, kind of.
990500	1004500	Um, okay, this one, this one kind of looks like a dinosaur or, or like a giraffe, um,
1004500	1010500	and the giraffe is like, it's like facing left, um, and you can see like the long neck
1010500	1013500	and then like a, like a rectangular body.
1014500	1016500	Does it have any triangles on the bottom?
1016500	1018500	No, no triangles on the bottom.
1018500	1020500	It has like a triangle head.
1031500	1037500	Um, okay, this is, this is the other one that looks like a giraffe, um, or like, yeah, and
1037500	1042500	then there, there are like triangles on the bottom and like, kind of like a tail.
1046500	1061500	Um, okay, this one is extremely weird looking, um, there's like, it looks like a dog and
1061500	1069500	then like something is on top of the dog, um, and there's like, it's, it's like one
1069500	1075500	of the two images where there's like a little triangle sticking out on the right side, almost
1075500	1081500	like a tail, um, except out of those two it, oh I think, okay, nice.
1088500	1097500	Um, okay, this one also looks like a dog, um, it's like facing to the left, um, and
1097500	1103500	it has triangles, or has like, kind of has triangles for feet, um, and it has like a
1103500	1105500	rhombus for a head.
1116500	1124500	Um, okay, this one is, this one isn't symmetrical but it's close to symmetrical, um, it's like
1124500	1131500	almost like a vertical pillar and there's like two triangles, nice.
1133500	1144500	Um, okay, this one also looks like a dog, except the dog is like, kind of, the head
1144500	1152500	is on the right side this time, um, and there's a tail with, um, like a little upside down
1152500	1157500	triangle as the tail and there's a square head on the right side.
1164500	1172500	Hmm, I don't know, a square head dog.
1172500	1182500	Yeah, kind of like a dog, um, I think the most distinct feature is an upside down little
1182500	1184500	triangle for the tail.
1185500	1191500	Oh, it just isn't an image that I've like already selected.
1191500	1192500	No, it's not.
1192500	1196500	I, I think it's actually the only one with an upside down triangle.
1200500	1201500	What?
1201500	1203500	I don't see it, okay.
1221500	1224500	Do you say it looks like a dog or like a duck?
1224500	1227500	Like a dog, kind of, like a dog.
1231500	1238500	Oh, there's no distinct feet, there's like not, there's no distinct legs so it looks
1238500	1242500	like the dog is like, maybe it's like jumping or something.
1242500	1250500	Um, but yeah, I think, I think the upside down triangle is probably the most, most recognizable
1250500	1251500	feature.
1253500	1256500	What do you mean by upside down triangle?
1256500	1264500	Um, it's like, uh, the tip of the triangle is pointing downwards and the top of the triangle
1264500	1266500	is completely flat.
1267500	1271500	Okay, I don't really see it so I'm just gonna...
1271500	1272500	Okay, no worries.
1275500	1277500	Oh, I thought you said it looked like a dog.
1278500	1280500	Yeah, maybe it doesn't.
1281500	1283500	It looks like a person to me.
1283500	1292500	Uh, um, okay, this one also looks kind of weird.
1292500	1300500	Um, there's like a square head and then like a little triangle that's hanging off of the
1300500	1302500	head on the right side.
1302500	1308500	Um, it also, it isn't symmetrical, it kind of looks symmetrical, close to symmetrical,
1308500	1313500	but there's a little triangle hanging off the right side of the head and on the bottom
1313500	1316500	left there's another small triangle.
1318500	1320500	Wait, can you repeat that?
1320500	1328500	Yeah, um, there's like a square head on top and then hanging off of the head on the right
1328500	1331500	side, uh, there's another triangle.
1335500	1337500	But it's like, it's disconnected a little bit.
1337500	1340500	So it's only touching at the points.
1341500	1342500	Yeah.
1350500	1356500	Um, okay, this looks like, oh, I think this is the one you selected when we were trying
1356500	1358500	to figure out the dog one.
1360500	1363500	Uh, like, like, okay, wait, I see.
1363500	1365500	It looks like, kind of like a ghost.
1365500	1366500	Yeah.
1376500	1384500	Um, okay, this looks like a person, um, but the left side of the person is completely
1384500	1385500	flat.
1385500	1390500	Um, it's just like a straight line on the left side and on the right side there's like
1390500	1396500	kind of an arm sticking out, uh, to the right, um, at the top.
1396500	1414500	Um, okay, this one's kind of, kind of weird looking.
1414500	1423500	Um, it looks like a scale, but it's like tilted 45 degrees to the right almost.
1424500	1435500	Um, there's like a triangle on the left side, um, that's like connected to this like vertical.
1435500	1438500	And it doesn't look like any particular person or animal?
1438500	1443500	No, it doesn't look like, it doesn't look like an animal or person.
1443500	1447500	Um, there's like, there's like a vertical beam.
1448500	1449500	Yeah.
1450500	1451500	Nice.
1453500	1468500	Um, okay, this also kind of looks like a person, um, except the, there's like a small triangle
1468500	1473500	and like an upside down triangle on the bottom right and it looks like there's one, like
1473500	1478500	one foot of the person and then there's like something sticking out on the left side of
1478500	1480500	the person as well.
1480500	1485500	Um, but there's like one, yeah, one upside down triangle all the way on the bottom right
1485500	1487500	corner of the image.
1490500	1494500	Um, and just like a regular square head.
1495500	1497500	Oh, okay.
1499500	1502500	So I think I like didn't hear like part of it.
1502500	1504500	No, you're good.
1505500	1516500	Um, okay, this one, this one looks, I don't know, kind of looks like a dog, like a dog
1516500	1521500	facing left and there's like a little triangle tail again.
1521500	1526500	Um, and then the little triangle is on the right side, the very right side of the image
1526500	1527500	on top.
1527500	1531500	Um, and there's like a triangle head for the dog.
1531500	1535500	And it kind of looks like a person is like riding it maybe.
1535500	1538500	Oh, I thought you said it looked like a dog.
1538500	1539500	Yeah.
1539500	1541500	Oh, I guess it kind of does.
1541500	1542500	Huh.
1542500	1548500	Uh, okay, this one also looks like a house except the chimney is on the right side.
1555500	1560500	How are the brain scans looking for the people listening on the internet?
1560500	1561500	I'm trying not to move.
1561500	1563500	I feel like I sort of pitch up my hands a little bit.
1563500	1565500	I'm going to try not to.
1568500	1571500	Um, I guess they don't hear me.
1571500	1572500	Oh, I don't know.
1572500	1573500	Okay.
1573500	1578500	Uh, this one looks like, oh, this is the, this is the one you selected.
1578500	1581500	It looks like kind of like a rabbit or a bunny.
1581500	1583500	Uh, there's like two triangles on top.
1583500	1586500	Oh, this is the misconstrued like potential dog.
1586500	1588500	Oh, wait, okay.
1590500	1599500	Um, okay, this looks like a person sitting down.
1599500	1602500	They're facing left and they have like two legs.
1602500	1607500	It looks like they're sitting, like sitting all the way down and their, their knees are off the ground.
1607500	1610500	Um, and their feet are also on the ground.
1610500	1613500	And the feet is an upside down triangle?
1613500	1615500	Uh, no, not really.
1616500	1619500	Um, the feet are like connected.
1619500	1622500	It's like they're sitting all the way down.

1635500	1636500	Yeah.
1645500	1664500	Um, I could hear for the most part.
1664500	1667500	There were some parts that got a little bit like muffled.
1667500	1669500	Uh, but otherwise it's okay.
1669500	1672500	I feel like at some point my head started to hurt a little bit.
1672500	1679500	I don't know if it's just because like the, um, head piece is like on kind of tight from the beginning, but I don't know.
1685500	1686500	Got it.
1686500	1688500	Okay, sorry about that.
1702500	1712500	Okay.
