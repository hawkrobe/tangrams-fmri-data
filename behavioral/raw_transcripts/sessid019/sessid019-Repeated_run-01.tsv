0	17720	Okay, the left side of the figure, well on the far left side it's a large triangular
17720	23120	cutout, and then on the far right side, far upper right side, there is a triangle connected
23120	30120	at one point that faces right.
30120	39240	Okay, in the center middle of the figure there is a rhombus that's connected at one point
39240	44520	to a right triangle that's connected to the central part of the figure.
44520	56560	The bottom right is a right triangle facing downward.
56560	61820	I think it's the only figure where the left side is a large triangular cutout with a peak
61820	62820	facing right.
62820	63820	Oh, okay.
63820	64820	I see, and there's a rhombus head.
64820	65820	Yeah.
65820	66820	Okay.
66820	83700	Okay, it looks like someone is doing a single leg squat.
83700	85900	The left side is a triangular cutout.
85900	92460	The left side is a triangular cutout, okay, rhombus head and parallelogram extending to
92460	99460	the bottom right.
99460	113460	Okay, it looks like the letter I, there's a small triangle about three-quarters of the
113460	119580	way up facing right, and then another small triangle at the bottom facing right.
119700	126420	The left side has a trapezoidal cutout, so it's like an I, and then there's like additional
126420	131420	shapes connected on the bottom half with the left side being a trapezoid cutout.
131420	146060	Okay, I think I got it.
146060	151460	It looks like a sphinx or a dog facing left.
151460	157940	The bottom left is a parallelogram, to the right of that there's a large white space
157940	162140	that's kind of like a parallelogram, but the right side has an additional triangle facing
162140	165500	right.
165500	188220	The center of the figure is a large rectangle on the left, yeah, I got it.
188220	196940	It looks like someone kneeling with a rhombus head, and then on the left side there's a
196940	203100	parallelogram cutout, on the right side the cutout is a large triangle with a peak facing
203100	204100	left.
204100	210540	The top of the figure is a rhombus head with a rhombus directly below it.
210540	217580	Okay, kneeling, arms extending to the right.
217580	233020	It looks like a person leaning against a wall facing left, rhombus head, it's a person
234020	251820	Okay, sitting on the ground, hugging their knees.
251820	256300	The top of the figure is two triangles that look like bunny ears, they're both connected
256300	260180	at one point to a large triangle that faces right.
260180	264260	The base of the figure is a parallelogram, with the point of contact being the base of
264260	267620	the parallelogram, so two points in a line.
267620	274420	On the middle left there's a rhombus that's connected at one point to a triangle.
274420	279780	Okay, the square's only connected at two points to the whole figure.
279780	281780	Okay, oh correct, yeah.
290180	301740	Okay, there's a rhombus head but it's, I wouldn't quite call it a head, it's more on the upper
301740	302740	left.
302740	307940	The base is a parallelogram, okay so sorry, scratch all that, start from the base, it's
307940	311740	a parallelogram with a long side on the ground, to the right of the parallelogram there is
311740	319780	a white cutout of a right triangle with the hypotenuse facing up left, to the right of
319780	325100	that there is another right triangle in black, connected at one point, the center of the
325100	327100	figure is like a large rectangle.
327100	330100	Okay, I think I got it.
340100	346100	Okay, it looks like another person kneeling, it's the one with the triangle on the bottom
346420	350820	left, there's a cutout triangle bottom left, and then on the right side there's a triangle
350820	354820	cutout, but the cheek is facing right, rhombus head.
354820	360820	And the cutout on the right of the triangle is slightly higher than the cutout on the left?
360820	361820	Yes.
361820	362820	Got it.
363540	379140	Uh, it's the person with the two small triangle feet, looks like a man with a square head
379140	381140	facing right with one arm extended downward.
381140	383140	Okay, and like a top hat?
383140	384140	Yes.
393140	403140	Um, the base is a large rectangle with two triangles that are, their bases are completely
403140	408140	connected to the short sides of the rectangle, there's a triangle, so in the middle of the
408140	412140	figure there's a triangle facing upward with a rhombus connected at only one point.
412140	413140	Okay.
423140	432140	Okay, starting from the bottom right, there is a small triangle equal, not equal at all,
432140	439140	a small triangle facing downward that's connected by sort of like a small pipe to the base,
439140	442140	the central base of the figure, which is a large triangle.
442140	451140	Then the top of the figure is a rhombus head connected at one point to an upside down right
451460	456460	triangle where the hypotenuse is facing the bottom right of the figure.
456460	457460	Hmm.
457460	464460	The right side of the, the cutout in this figure on the right side is a large trapezoid
464460	474460	where the top of the trapezoid is facing left and is, um, yeah, the left side.
474460	478460	I think I got it. On the bottom right there's a tiny, tiny triangle.
478780	481780	Yes, but it's connected by like a small rectangular portion.
481780	482780	Okay, yeah.
494780	496780	This looks like a flamingo jumping to the right.
496780	502780	There's a small triangle at the bottom left connected at only one point to, uh, the rest
502780	503780	of the figure.
503780	504780	Okay.
508780	523780	Okay, it somewhat resembles a person, um, with, uh, one foot on the ground.
523780	529780	The feet are triangles, but the upper half of each triangle is connected to a rectangle.
529780	532780	The other foot is sort of raised in the air.
532780	535780	Um, in the upper right of the figure, there's a rhombus head.
536100	537100	Uh.
537100	538100	Okay, I think I got it.
538100	540100	Slightly to the left of that, there's a triangular cutout.
540100	541100	Okay.
552100	555100	It looks like, uh, okay, there's bunny ears again.
555100	558100	They're connected to a rhombus.
558100	562100	That rhombus is connected to the tip of a large right triangle.
562420	567420	That comprises pretty much the whole figure, except the right triangle, uh, at the bottom
567420	573420	right, there's another triangle that intersects like 30% of the right triangle.
573420	575420	Okay, it's like a bunny facing right.
575420	576420	Yeah.
587420	589420	Okay, it looks like a top view of a crab.
589740	592740	Uh, the base is an upside-down trapezoid.
592740	595740	Oh, sorry, I accidentally clicked the...
595740	597740	Sorry, I knew that that was it.
597740	599740	I hit the wrong button.
602740	605740	Uh, it looks like a farmhouse with a chimney on the right side.
605740	606740	Okay.
607060	608060	Okay.
619060	623060	Okay, it looks like a person with a rhombus head.
623060	626060	Uh, there are two legs that are slightly different shapes.
626060	631060	It looks like their legs are, uh, like stretched out in both directions.
631060	635060	On the left side, it looks like a foot facing upward.
635380	638380	On the right side, it's just a parallelogram.
638380	639380	Okay.
639380	641380	I think I got it.
665380	666380	Okay.
671380	672380	Yeah, it feels good.
672380	673380	No problems.
675380	676380	Good.
676380	679380	I'm a little uncomfortable, but I think I just need to move a little bit.
684380	688380	Uh, just like my right arm is just a little uncomfortable.
688700	691700	Got it.
691700	694700	Can I just leave my left hand, um, down?
694700	697700	Yeah, okay, I think I'm all set then.
699700	700700	Okay.
708700	711700	Yeah, I think I was, like, kind of holding my arm up.
