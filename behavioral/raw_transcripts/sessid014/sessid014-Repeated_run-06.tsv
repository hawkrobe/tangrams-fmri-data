0	22760	This is the guy who's either having a good time or it's flying, the one we disagreed
22760	36400	about. This is the one that's symmetrical at the top and then juts out at the
36400	41000	bottom. It has those two kind of triangular cutouts at the top. It kind of
41000	53760	looks like a ghost. This one is the bamboo shoe or the lamppost with all the
53760	81200	speakers. This is the horse that has no front legs. This is the pine cone. It's
81240	96400	got the flat square at the top. This is the person sitting with their back to the wall
96520	110920	on the right of them. They've got their head tilted down. This is the cliff that has a
110920	114920	very flat side on the left and then a jagged side on the right and you've got like a square
114920	130920	at the top of it. This is the other cliff that has the square pushing the triangle off
130920	143320	of it to the left or to the right. That's the right. This is the symmetrical shape that's
143320	159320	hard to describe. It has the trapezoidal cutout at the very top. This is the house
159320	176320	with the smokestack to the right of it. Tall. This is the giraffe with no legs or I guess
176320	193320	the tracheosaurus with no legs. This is the person holding a wide glass with the long
193320	201320	robe. The wide glass is like a tiny little upside down triangle off to the left and it
201320	211320	has a square head pointing to the top. This one is the ballerina. It's got the leg pointing
211320	227320	out behind him to the right, two arms heading out to the front. This is the hard to describe
227320	241320	figure with the tiny triangle head and it looks like it's holding a box. This is the
241320	247320	person wearing a skirt and kind of sitting down. She's got her foot out. It's like a
247320	271320	little triangle pointing down. This is the scuba diver. This one is the shrimp or the
271320	291320	gun. Kind of curves around. This one is the one that I got wrong. It's the dancer. She's
291320	315320	got the long train on her skirt to the back.
